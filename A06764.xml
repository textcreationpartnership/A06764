            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

leaue it for other to do. It ſuffiſeth them to haue the title, the rents and the honoure of a buſshop, as in effect they wold declare that they be no buſshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes (as in dede they be not) except onely in name, and in dede yf they were trew buſshoppes, they wold not be ashamed to doo theire office, as Auſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, Ambroſe, Ciprian, Chriſoſtom, Baſile, Gregory, and other holy fathers were not ashamed, the which taught and preached the word of god. This is the trew fedinge which Christ commaunded Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in S. Ihon the last chapter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan.</hi> 15.21. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> and the ſame Peter alſo in his firſt Epistle the <hi>5.</hi> chapter ſaith, feede ſo muche as in you is (that is to ſay) ſo much as you can and according to youre habilitie, the flock of Chriſt, or els as the other text ſaith, feed the flock of Christ which is in you, that is to ſay, which is com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to you in charge. Of this diſorder it commeth to paſſe that the cleane, pure and trew doctrine of the goſpel and of the word of god doth want among the people, and as thorow a wide and large gate, be entred abuſes, ſuperſtitions and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours among the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flock.

decay in his chyrche, and it is a most ſingular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of god, that yet in a few (albeit euell handeled of the world) who be in dede the true church the faith doth remaine, Yea, I ſay that if the world in temporall gouernements had not had better rule and order then the estate called Eccleſiaſticall, it should haue run<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into an vtter confuſion and deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye.

In old tyme this offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was bestowed on the poore by the deacons hands, but now euery man knoweth to what vſe it turneth. When the offertory is done, the hoste not yet conſecrated (is offered as they ſay) and this pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yer is ſaid.

               <p>When the host is offered, and the wine in the challice, they alſo put to it water, which thing they ſay, that Alexander the first pope, ordened.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly it is to declare, that there iſſued out of Chriſts ſyde together with the blood, water, in token that Christ is not without the people, nor the people without Christ.

the Wyne. I wil not at this preſent take on me the burdene of reprouing Alexander, but I will yet tell what I thinke, that in the Sacrament there ought to be made (reſpecting thoſe thinges that be the ſubstance of them) no maner of chaunge, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to encreaſe nor to diminish. It is alread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>en that Chriſt did not inſtitute the Sacrament of the holy ſuper with any other elements then with bread and wyne, and that no water in it: nor the apoſtels (as farr as we vnderſtand by there wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) haue added any other thinge. This me think ſhuld ſuffiſe. Then euen as it belongeth not, to any man in the world but to god and Chriſt that is god and man to inſtitute Sacraments ſo ought no liuing man to diminish it, and ſeme to vnderſtand more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordeiner. Who is that inferiour that wold alter or chaunge the lawes or ordinaunces of his ſuperiour? after this ſort then, men might doo in baptiſme, they might put to wyne, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the cauſe, as is aledged of the water, why ſhould water be rather put to the wyne in the Sacrament of the holy ſuper then wyne to the water in the ſacrament of baptiſme? was not the godhed and manhede aſwel in baptiſme as in the holy ſupper? Yea they were more plainely beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was baptiſed, for that that was
<pb facs="tcp:12148:27"/>
the fathers voyce, the holy goſt was ſeene in shape of a doue, which things neuer chaunced in the ſupper, ſo far as we vnderstand by the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and writinges of the apoſtles. And whie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the godhed and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hed be betokened, by wyne and water aſwel in the one Sacrament as in the other.</p>
               <p>Forthermore none, except the ordeiner, hath authoritie to geue a new betokening to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Chriſt hath apointed what the bread and wine shuld betoken, that is to ſaye, that the bread shuld betoken and bringe to remembraunce the bodye and the blud, and it belongeth not to vs, to chaunge, to put to or take fro, the betokenings of ſuche things. And this opinion here ſaith that the wyne betokeneth the godhead, and Chriſt hath or deined that it shuld betoken and bringe to oure re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membraunce his blud. There is a great difference betwene the blud and the godhed for the blud is a creature, but the godhed is god the Creator. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paule, who was taught of Chriſt (as he wryteth to the Corinthians after what ſort this Sacrament ought to be handeled) maketh no maner mention of water, and he durſt not put to any thinge beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that which Chriſt had taught him. And by what authoritie I pray you, go they, and add to

And let them neuertheles, alledge as many reaſons as they will, yet they ought to ſpeak it a loude, but this ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth not ſo much matter, as the wicknedeſſes and blaſphemies, that are in ſome of them, and among the rest in that of the fourth ferye of the Imber dayes in aduent which ſaith: let oure fastings (we beſeche the oh lord) be acceptable vnto the, which by clenſing vs, maye make vs worthy of thy grace, and bring vs to the euerlasting promeſſes.

Paule ſaith to the Romains, we be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by his grace (that is Gods) by the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in Chriſt Ieſus. In which place appointinge the things that perteine to iustification, he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, grace, the redemption by Chriſte, and faith, which wholly he geueth to the grace of god by Christ, and no whit to man: yea rather he turneth out all the glory of man, and geueth the whole ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure and glory to God. Which he wold not haue done if oure works (whether they be faſtings or other works) had pertained to iustification, as any cauſe therof. Moreouer how canne fastings purge or clenſe ſinnes, ſeing that we must first be loſed and clenſed, before we can do eny work, that may be thankfull to God, whether it be faſting or other work? How can fastings take away ſinnes, yf they be not thankfull to God? and if they be thankfull to God, it is neceſſary that oure ſinnes should firſt be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12148:29"/>
forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, and that we should be clenſed of them. Faſtings therfore cannot cauſe forgeuenes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nether in whole nor in parte, yea let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think this before hand that yf they should be acceptable vnto god, forgeuenes of ſinnes muſt neceſſarylye goo before them. And if it should be ſayd that in the end of the praier there is, <hi>Per Dominum noſtru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſum Chriſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, etc.</hi> Which words confeſſe that oure ſinnes are forgeuen by Chriſt: to this is anſwerd that ether they will that by Ieſus Chriſte himſelf onely our ſinnes should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen, or els not onely by Chriſt, but by Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the faſtings. If they will by Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why do they alledge faſtings? yf they will haue faſtings together with Chriſt, this is firſt againſt the ſcriptures, which thorowout alledge Chriſt onely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d none other. Further it is plaine that the reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore made reſteth ſtronge, that is, that forgeuenes of ſinnes go before faſtings if they shalbe thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to god, then faſting cannot, becauſe of forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenes of ſinnes nether with Chriſt nor without Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And if thei wold ſay we meane not of forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinnes as concerning the faulte, but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to this I ſay that when men ſpeak abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of the clenſing or forgeuinge of ſinne, it is
<pb facs="tcp:12148:30"/>
to be vnderſtand of the faulte as of the chefe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in that forgeuenes and here the praier ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth abſolutely: wherfore it is vnderſtand of the fawt and not of the paine only. Than if the fawt be forgeuen and taken away, we ought not to be any more poniſshed for the cauſe of that fawt. For ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke away the caus, and the effect foloweth. This is a generall rule, where there is no fawt, there ought not to be any poniſshment. If god doo thorowly for gyue and take away the fawt, he taketh a way alſo the poniſshment, dewe for that fawt. And this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction which is comonly made of the forgeuenes of the paine a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the fawt, hath no maner fowndacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in holy ſcriptures, but is fownd owt by men. And though ſomtymes, god forgiuing the fawt doth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me way poniſsh, as he did Dauyd and certen other, yet this is not, that the poniſshme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shuld remayne, as the poniſshme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for other reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, as to humble the man, and to exercyſe hym, or to geue example to other that thei doo not the like, and that he alſo may be ware in tyme to come, that he fall not in ſuch or like owtrage. This ſentence is S. Auſtens in his II. booke called of the deſertys of ſinnes and of forgeuenes the <hi>33.</hi> and <hi>34.</hi> chapters, Where he bringeth in the paines laid on Dauid and other godly men, and ſayth that thei remayne not,

Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other wordes which ſay that faſtings make vs whorty of gods grace (that is) that thei make vs deſerue it, is an error a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an hereſye by all meanes to be condemned,<note place="margin">De predeſt natione ſan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> as S. Auſten ſayth in his boke of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deſtynacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſaynts. And it was Pelagius the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes error, condemned in the cowncell at Paleſtina by Pelagius him ſelff, leſt els he ſhuld haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned. He ſayth the ſame in his <hi>105.106.107.</hi>

Auſten and other lerned men, hauing the wordes of S. Paul to the Romai. ſo plaine, where he ſaith that that which is by grace, is not by workes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> that is to ſay, is not by deſertes. And ſo of the contrary part, that which is by workes is not by grace, els grace ſhuld not be grace, nor workes (that is to ſay deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes) shuld not be workes. For the thing that is deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued is not by grace. And that which is by grace is not by deſertis or workes. But this praier denieth grace, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wrappeth in it a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie. For the thing that is deſerued, as we haue ſaid, is not by grace but by workes. And therfor iff our faſtings shuld be worthy of gods grace, and that we ſhuld deſerue it, than grace shuld not be grace, which is an enw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapping of contradiction, as the for ſaid S. Auſten
<pb facs="tcp:12148:31"/>
in the alledged booke ſaith,<note place="margin">De predeſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>natione ſan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> That grace in no wiſe is grace iff it be geuen according to deſertes.</p>
               <p>The third part of the praier ſaith that faſting brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth vs to the euerlaſting promiſes, that is to ſay, to euerlaſting glory. He that ſeeth not that this is an vnſufferable blaſphemy is blind, ſeing that men can not be ſauid by their workes but by the grace of god thorow Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.</note> as we lerne of Paule in ſo many places. And of S. Peter in the actes. There is non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name vnder heauen, geuen to men, wherby we shuld be ſaued. And this praier wold that by the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me of workes we shuld become ſafe.</p>
               <p>There is a nother ſecret praier on the xxiij. ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day affter whitſontide which ſaith thus, Take o helpfull lord, the hoſtes, with which thow woldeſt be pleaſed and haue ſaffety reſtored vnto vs thorow thy mighty mercy. This ſecret ſaith here ij. things. Firſt that god deſyreth to be pleaſed by the hoſtes which the prieſt offereth. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly it ſaith that god wold by theſe hoſtes haue ſafety reſtored vnto vs. And where wold god euer be pleaſed by that bread and that wine which are not yet a ſacrament, moch leſſe haue our ſafetie reſtored by them. From whens haue they that god wold ſuch things shuld be done
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12148:31"/>
by thes offerings? In what place of the ſcripture fynd thei that? The ſcripture ſaith that by Chriſt god is pleaſed with vs, as we haue in Eſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24.</note> where it is writen, Behold my ſeruant whom I haue choſen, my welbeloued,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.</note> in whom my ſowle is moch deligh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, which ſaing Mathew alledgeth ſomwhat diuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe in wordes but not in ſenſe. For in ſteade of that word which the Prophete calleth ſeruant, mathew ſaith, Son<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it is the very ſame in ſenſe. For chriſt in that he is man, is gods ſeruant and is yet for all that gods ſonn. The father alſo ſaith as it is written in the euangeliſtes, whan chriſt was baptiſed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Marc.</hi> 1. <hi>Luc.</hi> 3.</note> and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo at that time whan he was tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfigured, This is my welbeloued ſon in whom I am well pleaſed. Which ſaings all, doo giue vs to vnderſtond that god is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by Chriſt, and by him are all men reconciled.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> Paul ſaith the like to the romai. We being enemies are reconciled to god by his ſonnes death. And to the Coloſſeis it is ſaid, that it hath pleaſed the father to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile all things to him bi Christ, being pacified by the blood of chriſtes own croſſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coll.</hi> 1.</note> Theſe ſaings of Paul are clere and plaine, and affirme that chriſt is he, by whom god is pacified and men reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And this praier or ſecret ſaith that god will be pacified by thoſe offerings, Which are yet no other but Comon breade and wine, and are not yet any ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament.
<pb facs="tcp:12148:32"/>
Likewiſe thother point of the praier, that by thoſe offerings, we might haue ſafetie, is a great blaſphemy. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as by Chriſt only god is pacified towards vs, ſo by him and not by any other thing, We haue ſafetie. Seing then that chriſt is our only ſauior, this is ſure a gret raſshnes, and a deueliſsh ſelf likinge to talk ſo boldly of our ſafetie withowt the holy ſcripture, yea againſt gods word. And iff any to defend this praier, wold ſay, that by thes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings is not ment that thei than be, but that thei ſhall be, and at that time whan thei ſhall be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. To this we haue allredy anſwered, in the chapter before, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the praier of the offring of the hoſt not yet conſecrated was examined. There is yet a great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of thes ſecreates which declare, that that breade and that wine not yet conſecrated, take away ſinnes, and forgeue them. But of this will we ſpeake in the end, where we will proue that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth not take away ſinnes, nor forgiue them, moch leſſe the breade and wine ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take away ſinne beinge not yet conſecrated (that is to ſay) yelded to an holy vſe, For to conſecrate is none other thing then to yeld a thing vp to an holy vſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>WE therfor, O moſt mercifull father, by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt thy ſonn, our lord doo humbly pray and deſire the, that thow wilt accept theſe gyfftes, theſe preſentys, and theſe vnſpotted ſacry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices.</q> (And here muſt be made iij. croſſes ouer the hoſt, and the chales likewiſe) And he addeth. <q>Firſt that we offer to the, for thy holi catholike church, which vouchſafe thow to quiet, to kepe, to Ioyne to gether, and to gouerne in euery part of the ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes compaſſe, to gether with thy ſeruant our Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe, and our biſshop (And here is the Pope, and the biſshop of that dyoceſſe where the maſſe is ſaid, named by name.</q> Or iff thei be friars or mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes that celebrate, thei name their generall or Abbat, and affter he addeth this. That is to ſay, And for all the right opinioned, and kepers of the catholyke and apoſtolik faith.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt of the xi. partis of the canon. In which it is deſtred that the breade, and the wyne, may be accepted for the church, for the pope, for the biſshops, for the generals fryars or mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, and for all the right opinioned, and kepers of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik

and apoſtolik faith. And it is affirmed, that that bread and that wyne, not yet conſecrated, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re holy and vndefiled ſacrifices which are offered to god for the church a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for all thos that are there mencioned. And here is no great hardnes, for the wordes be plaine inough, except that thoſe iij. croſſes which are made ouer the breade and wyne shuld betoken ſome very great misteries. Maſter William durant ſaith here, that thes iij. croſſes doo betoken the iij. deliueries of Chriſt, the firſt when god deliuerid his ſon to the world, the ſecond whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudas deliuerid him to the Iewes, and the third whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes deliuerid him to death.

And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12148:35"/>
why is ther not mencion made of it in thes croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? He ſaith alſo that thes iij. croſſes are made, in the worship of the trinitie, and alſo in betokening the threfold vnion in the acceptacion of Christ.

So that this our maſter Durant, allegeth as many ſignifications of thes iij. croſſes as there are threfoldneſsis or nombers of thre Imagined. Behold now the great miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Canon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer who hath auctoriſed him that made this Canon to giue ſo many ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions to thes croſſes? Is it in mans powr to doo it? Thes things, to him that vnderſtandeth, are ſuperſticious, and vnknowen, not only of the Apoſtles, but alſo of the primatiue, and puer church. I could, if I wold, touch that matter, how that bread, and that wine, not yet conſecrated, could be ſacrifices which are offered for the whole church and for all the faithfull: but of this matter we will ſpeake more here affter when we will proue, Yea that the bread and wine conſecrated, that is to ſay, whan thei be, a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:12148:36"/>
are no ſacrifyces: but only a memory of the trew ſacrifice, thei be ſo muche leſſe ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whan as yet thei be not a ſacrament, that is to ſay not yet conſecrated, as we shall further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The ſecond part of the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the <hi>momen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to,</hi> which is a prayer that is made for the liuing, and it is this, Lord remember thy ſeruants men and wemen. (And in this place, praier is made for certen particular parſons, as ſemeth good to hym that ſayth the maſſe, and affter he addeth, And all the bowt ſtanders whos faith is plaine vnto the, and their deuocion knowen. For whom we offer vnto the, or els they offer vnto the, this ſacrifice of praiſe, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and for all theirs, for redempcion of their ſowles for the hope of helth, and for their ſafetie.

               </p>
               <p>In this <hi>memento</hi> ther is nothing but may be eaſily vnderſtand.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12148:36"/>
Chriſt, becauſe it ſemeth, that Chriſt shuld not haue redemed thos ſowles, as withowt dowt he hath done. And he firſt promyſed it, and all the ſcriptures affirme,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 20, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> that he nedeth no more to doo it. Paul to the hebrewes ſayth that Chriſt hath fownd owt the euerlaſting redempcion. In the Apocalipſe, Iohn ſaith,<note place="margin">

And how many ſaings, iff we wold, and alſo nede were, could we bring forth? But it nedeth not in ſo plaine a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to alledge moo witneſsis. Shuld we confeſſe, (as this praier doth) that with breade and wine is made the redempcion of our ſowles? Chriſt only is our redemer, and not the bread, nor the wine, vnconſecrated, no nor when they be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, (as thei call it.) But let vs admitt that thei were conſecrated (which not with ſtonding thei be not) and that Chriſt were with vs bodily in parſon, yet it shuld not nede any more to offer him for the redempcion of our ſowles, becauſe he hym ſelff hath done that withowt vs, and hath offered hym ſelff ones for euer, to bring that to paſſe. What nedeth it than any more to offer him for that purpos? Ought we not to beleue that our

goſpell how could it be certenly known? And how shall we be bownd to beleue it. Likewiſe this is the cauſe why things lefft owt by one euangelist are knowen, becauſe a nother doth tell them, but if all had lefft them owt, how could we certenly knowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? O ſai thei, the church had it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostels, Saist thow ſo, how doest thow knowe it?

Why than doth he not putt in thes wordes? Iff in the conſecration there were nothing conſidered but the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, it made no matter though ſome words were added or miniſshed, ſo that the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce were not altered. But the conſideracion here is of the wordes, that is to ſay, what thei be to which Chriſt hath ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen the powr to conſecrate, and to them it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth not to add or to miniſsh. All this I ſay according to their opinion. For thei wold that Chriſt shuld haue geuen the vertew of
<pb n="04" facs="tcp:12148:41"/>
conſecrating, to the wordes which he himſelff ſpake and not to other. And yet thes wordes, that I ſay are added, be neither in theuange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes nor in Paule. Here muſt we ſay, that Paul taught not to conſecrate well, becauſe he ſpake them not. Or els iff Paul taught to conſecrate well, that Christ ſpake not thos wordes. And if Chriſt ſpake them not, thei haue vſed a great raſshnes that haue added them, ſpecyally, hauing that opinion that thei haue of the conſecracion, that is to ſay, of the powr geuen to thos wordes only that Chriſt pronownced. Moreouer what is the cauſe that in the conſecracion of the bread are not putt in thes wordes which christ pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, that is <hi>Quod ꝓuobis datur</hi> which is giuen for yow, as Luke ſaith, or els <hi>ꝙ pro uobis tradet</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gitur,</hi> which is broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for yow, as Paul ſaith, as in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wine there be thes wordes, Which shall be shed for yow and for many for the remiſsion of ſinnes, the body being no leſſe geuen for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcion than the blood? Why haue thei in this part maymed the wordes of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracion of the breade and not thos of the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecracion of the wine; let euery man Iudge if this ought to be done. But this is the beſt of the matter, that the defenders of the
<pb facs="tcp:12148:42"/>
maſſe to mainteine it, ſay that that breade and that wyne is changed, the one in to the body, that is to ſay the bread, and the other in to the blood, that is the wyne. And are muche combe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe thei can not tell what is shewed by this demonſtratiue, <hi>Hoc</hi> whan is ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> that is to ſay, this is my body. If by this word <hi>Hoc,</hi> be shewed the breade, the ſaing is falſe, becauſe the breade is not changed in to the body, till all the wordes of the conſecracion be vttered. Iff the body be shewed, it ſemeth that the body shuld be there before the wordes were ſpoken, and before the conſecracion shuld be made. And we haue the like to ſay of the wordes of the conſecracion of the wine, which thing is declared whan is ſaid, <hi>Hoc e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. n. ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guis meus &amp;c.</hi> Iff the wine be shewed, it is falſe that the wine shuld be blood.

And therfor ſome ſay affter one ſort and ſome affter a nother, and to be short thei knowe not what thei may ſay.</p>

my body that is to ſay, that into which this thing shall be tranſſubſtantiate, is my body. And this is the opinion of Rychard of S. Victor in his boke of the trinitye. Certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other ſay that the with comes of the breade are shewed, And this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is my body, is as moch to ſay, as in this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

But chriſtes wordes only are repeated. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> other the contray appeareth, ffor whan Chriſt pronownced thos wordes, he shwed ſome thing and did conſecrate. Therfor now alſo, being the ſame wordes and hauing the ſelff ſame vſe that thei had whan Chriſt ſpake them, thei shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the ſelff ſame ſignificacion.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecrate, that is <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum</hi> and <hi>hic eſt ſanguis meus.</hi> And whan the priest pronownceth thes wordes, the breade is changed into the body, and the wine in to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> bloode. There be other that ſay that Christ conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crated with other wordes than thes <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and that he conſecrated whan he bleſſed. Peter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meſtor ſaith that Chriſt conſecrated with thes wordes <hi>Hoc eſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus meum</hi> and <hi>hic eſt ſanguis meus</hi> but he ſpake them ſofftly to him ſelff and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the breade in to the body and the wine in to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the blood, and affter he repeated them with a lowd voice to the apoſtels.

Abowt the forme of conſecrating of the wine, ſome ſay, as Bonauentu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> in the iiij. of the ſentences the viij. distinction, and many other, that thes wordes <hi>hic eſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix ſanguinis mei</hi> be of the ſubſtance of the forme of conſecrating the wine the other which be added, that is to ſay, <hi>Noui &amp; aeter ni teſtamenti,</hi> be only to furniſsh. Thomas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> of Aquine in the iij. part of his ſomm, ſaith that all thes wordes be of the ſubſtance. Scotus ſaith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that being vnknowen for certenty whether thei be of the ſubſtance of the form or not, that men ought not to determine that it shuld be ſo, but thei ought to ſay all, as iff thei were of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the forme, albeit that comonly the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors agree with Bonauenture. And here is to be noted that according to the opinion of Scotus, it is not yet knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what shuld be the wordes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecracion of the wine, but in part. It is ſure that he ſaid the truth, that neither he nor Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor Thomas of Aquina nor as many moo ſcole doctors as be defenders of the maſſe, euer knewe certenly the very poinctt which
<pb facs="tcp:12148:44"/>
shuld be the partes of conſecracion, And this is the profe theroff. For iff thei had knowen it, there shuld not haue bene ſo great a diuerſitie and confuſion of opinions as we haue ſene. And we could yet, (iff we wold) ſpeake of others. This their ſo gret diuerſitie, sheweth plainely that thei neuer knewe it nor neuer were certen of the matter. And it is moſt certen that iff the opinion that thei defend were trewe, there shuld neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue bene ſo many and ſo diuers opinions.</p>
               <p>What a vaine thing is it than to ſay that by the vertu of certen wordes shuld be made a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the breade and the wyne in to the body and blood of Chriſt, which thing not withſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by the holy ſcripture ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be shewed, that is, that by the vertu of certen wordes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of things shuld be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, and of the other part not to knowe or not to be certen which shuld be thos wordes? Thei ſpeake alſo in ſuch ſort of this conſecratoin, that affter their owne opinion, the church or the peple that heare the maſſe are neuer certen whether the conſecracion be made or not. For the maſter of ſentencis ſaith in the iiij. that the heretikes can not bring it to paſſe, that is to ſay, to conſecrate. And alſo he ſaith, yow muſt haue the intent, for otherwiſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12148:44"/>
yow conſecrate not. And who can be certen, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faith or of the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him that celebra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth? Surely no man, being ſuch things in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciens of man which none ſeith but god and he that celebrateth. Therfor the peple that heare the maſſe, is neuer certen whan the conſecracion is made and whan not. The cauſe whi this confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them, firſt is becauſe thei knowe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly what maner of thing conſecracion is. For conſecracion meaneth one thing, and thei thinck it shuld haue a nother meaning. Beſides thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue or at the leaſt cauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thinck that thei be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue, and thei preach the ſame as an article of the faith, that that breade and that wine is changed thone in to the trew a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciall body of Chriſt, (that is to ſay the breade) the other (that is to ſay the wyne) in to his blood. And thei ſay that Chriſt really in body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſowle, as gret and as thick as he was vpon the wood of the croſſe, and as now he is in heauen, is wholly in that litle hoſt and wholly in that cupp where the wine was. And thei will that here there shuld come to gether many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and thei hold that this meruelos change, which thei call tranſſubſtanciacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shuld be done by the vertu of thos wordes of the conſecracion, And thei will that conſecracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth meane chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb facs="tcp:12148:45"/>
of breade in to the body, and of wine in to the blood, made with thes wordes.

So doo they, that thinck with thes wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des ſpoken ſoftly ouer the breade and the wyne, to change by vertu of the ſame, the bread and the wyne in the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thes ij. be the cauſes why they know not with what wordes, the conſecratyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made, nor wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is made. ffor hauing that opinyon that they ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue, that is to ſay, that there is made that merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous change of bread a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine, thes wordes <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> make than the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and they knowe not what thing is shwesd by this word, <hi>hoc,</hi> For iff the breade be shewed the ſaing appeareth falſs vnto them, becauſe the breade is not the body of Chriſt tyll all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be ſpoken, and whan they shewe the breade, the wordes be not yet ſpoken. Than ſeing the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy is not yet there, there can not be shewed by this word, <hi>hoc,</hi> the body which yet is not.

                  <q>THe viij. part of the canon, is this, that is to ſay, Wherfor we thy ſeruantes and thy holy peple, remembring vs of christ thy ſonn our lord of ſo bleſſed a paſsion and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the deade, and of the glorios aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion in to the heauens, doo offer to thy moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maiestie of thy rewardes and gifftes, the pure host, the holy host, the vnſpotted host.</q> (and here ſaing thes wordes are made iij. croſſes ouer the host and ouer the cup conſecrated, to gether, that is to ſay ouer both of them. And affter he ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth) <q>Holy breade of life euerlasting and the cup of continuall helth, (And here ij. other croſſes be made, the one whan the bread is named ouer the ſame host, and the other ouer the cupp whan the ſame is named.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this viij. part, is affirmed that the priest and the peple by the remembrans that thei haue of his death, reſurrection and aſcenſion, doo offer vnto god that host and that cupp conſecrated, which be, as thei think, the trewe body and very blood of Christ. But where is it fownd in all the whole ſcripture that Christ or god did euer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein that either the prieſt or the peple shuld offer vnto god the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt? In de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12148:48"/>
we find that we ought to make a memory of ſuch an offering as christ hath made. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for he hath ordeined this ſacrament to thintent that we shuld vſe the remembrance of that obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. But that we ought to offer to god either the body or the bloode of his ſonn, that hath god not appointed vs, nor yet Christ nor ani Apostel, euer made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion of it. For this office to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to god the body and blood of christ, belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to christ, who is the high a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euerlasting priest,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.9.10.</note> and it belongeth not to vs. And the ſome christ hath done it ones for all, whan he was offered and died vpon the croſſe. And it nedeth not to doo it offtner, becauſe that that only time hath ſuffiſed to ſatiſfie god for the ſinnes of all the elect. And that which we doo now in the ſacrament, is not the offering of Chriſtes body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blood but is a me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mory of that offering. And who knoweth not, that the memory of a thing, is not the ſelff ſame thing, but a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of it? And if ani wold ſay for all this, that it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to christians to offer chriſt in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe Peter ſaith that the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be an holy priesthoode, to offer ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all offrings acceptable to god by Ieſus christ, To this I ſay, that Peter meaneth not here to ſpeake of the ſacrament, but meaneth of thos hostis, that is to ſay, ſpirituall ſacrifices, the which not only
<pb facs="tcp:12148:49"/>
the prieſtes, but all christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may and ought to of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer vnto god, accepted by Ieſus Christ. And thes ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes or ſacrifices, we be first our ſelffes, which ou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ght to offer our ſelues u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to god asſ. Paul exhorteth to the romans, ſaing, I pray yow that yow will gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue vp or offer your bodies an holy, liuing, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing hoſt vnto god, which is your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing of god.

And to proue that this is trowth, Peter ſpeketh not here to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis only, but he ſpeaketh to all the christen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and to all the faithful whom he calleth a cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen peple, a kingly presthode &amp;c. The preſt than that ſaith the maſſe, vſurpeth the office that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth only to christ. But we will ſpeake of this yet more largily in the iiij. part.</p>
               <p>There foloweth further more in this part, a pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ier, <q>that is to ſaie, Vpon which things (or els) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which gifftes (and ſpeaketh of that host, and that wine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated, which affter their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the trewe body and the naturall blood of Chriſt) Vpon ihe which things (ſaith he) vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaue to looke, with an helpfull and a fauorable

For in this praier, is deſiered that god wold accept the body and bloo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of Ieſus Christ, as he accepted the gifftes and ſacrifices of thes iij. that is to ſay, of Abel, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and Melchiſedeck, which were plainly men, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not withowt ſinne (although iust by gods gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce) and had nede of the forgeuenes of ſinnes.

the body and blood of christ is withowt meaſure more accepted tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as many ſacrifices as euer we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re made in the world?

Thes be thos great misteries that this canon hath, which Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Durant expowndeth with ſo great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But ſome man may parauenture ſay, that there is not deſiered in this praier abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly that the body and the blood of Ieſus Christ for themſelues, shuld be acceptable to god as the ſacrifices of thos iij. holy men, becauſe there is no dowt, but that thei be more acceptable, for them ſelues, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the ſacrifices of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. But there is deſiered, that thei may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to god for vs, and ſo is the praier to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtond. This anſwer ſemeth ſuttle, and ſom conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tios man might paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture shew him ſelff ſtowt with it, but it is nothing worth. For let them ſay

what thei will, it shall be allwaies inconuenient. ffor iff they wil deſyre that the body and blood of Iheſus Chriſt (for them ſelues) ſhuld be accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table to god, as the ſacrifices of ſimple men, no man wil euer ſay, that this shuld be conueniente.

               <p>The bleſsing of the frankince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the maſs booke immediatly foloweth that of the fire.

This is to trewe, but it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror comon to all the ceremonies of the maſſe.

and to be short, ſo great a diuerſitie of things which be vſed in the maſſe. And yet the peple vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not why thei are done.

The Rationall of diuine offices, maketh ſo many ſignificacions, ſo many miſteries of ſuch things, and yet no one, or very fewe doo knowe them. Well it is ynough that thei be writton in the boke.

the acceptable tyme and the time of grace) Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes grace shuld be of leſſe vertu and ſtrength tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he came?

Why now than shall not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes grace haue the ſame vertu? It is plaine that a thing that can worck his effect with owt anothere helpe, is of more efficacie, force and ſtrength, than that which hath nede of it. Iff than now gods grace and Chriſtes vertu haue nede of ſacraments to worck this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of forgeuenes of ſinnes, and before it hath not nede, it is ſurely of leſſe ſtrength now than in that time, for by it ſelff it can not worck that that it could doo than whan Chriſt yet was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in the fleſsh.

How many ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples alſo haue we in the newe testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the forgeuenes of ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es is not cauſed by the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I anſwer as before, that thoffice of the ſacraments is to be witneſsing ſignes of thes ſaid things and thei be as it were certen ſealis which aſſure vs of the forgeuenes of ſinnes, of gods grace, and of ſaluacion.

that Chriſt shuld deliuer from ſuch a curſe, thos that bileue in him. So that this distinction, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king properly, is nothing. For the ſinne which they call veniall, iff it be ſinne, it is against the lawe. Iff it be againgſt the lawe, it curſeth and damneth. Iff it curſe and damne it is deadly. Nor by this that is ſaid, that euery ſinne is deadly, is ment that all ſinnis are like as certen haue ſaid. Nor it denieth not that one ſinne is gretter than another.

Than that the thanksge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing shuld forgiue the veniall and not the deadly ſinnes, is fals. For the forgeuenes of ſinnes is gods perfight work. Nor god forgeueth not a man one ſinn, but he forgiueth him all.

They haue it not owt of thold ſcripture for it ſpeaketh not of the maſſe, becauſe it was not than, nor owt of the newe.

This doth Chriſt him ſelff ſay, whan he did inſtitute the ſame holy ſupper, as Mathew,<note place="margin">

Iff the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſelff forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, how doth it betoken that Christ doth forgeue them? So than it ſelff will forgeue them and not Chriſt. Here thei alledge that the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Ambros, Auſten and others did call it a ſacrifice. And therfor thei alſo call it a ſacrifice. <q>Than further thei ſay that the ſcripture ſaith the ſame, that is to ſay the Prophete malachy the which ſaith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.</note> I haue no delite in yow, that is to ſay, yow pleaſe me not ſaith the lord of hoſtis. And I wil not take the gifft at your hand, for that from theast to the west, my name is gret among the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:12148:89"/>
Loo here thei ſay that the maſſe is a ſacrifice, the which from theaſt to the weſt, is made to god called by the Prophet a cleane offering the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch in euery place is ſacrificed, In fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in Spaine, in flanders, in Almany in Italy and euery where. To thes ſo feble profes, I first anſwer that thold fathers called the ſupper of the lord a ſacrifice me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aning that it was a rememberans of the ſacrifice as the ſtone owt of which came furth the water in the deſert, was called Christ no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> becauſe it was in dede Christ, but becauſe it did ſignifie Christ. Nor this is not mine, but the fathers expoſition them ſelues.

And allthough that all thold men shuld ſay that it we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re in dede a ſacrifice, not bringing gods word for them we shall not be bownd to byleue them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it behoueth that ſuch a thing belonging to our faith, shuld be grownded vpon gods word a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not vp on mennes. To the ſaing of Malachy, I ſay, that it proueth not their intent, becauſe thei must iff thei will that that ſaing shuld be to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos, proue that Malachy shuld ſpeake of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe. Malachy ſaith that in euery place is offered and ſacrificed to god the cleane offring, he ſaith trewe, but he ſaith not that this cleane offring is the maſſe or the ſacrament of the lords ſupper. He only maketh mencion of the cleane offring a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d telleth not what that is. How trifle thei to geſſe affter this ſort, ſaing that he ſpeaketh of the maſſe or of the ſacrament? Thei must first shewe that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12148:90"/>
the maſſe is a ſacrifice, And affterward that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy shuld ſpeake of the maſſe, or els of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament But thei shall neuer proue neither tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nor thother, I ſay, by gods word. Than further let vs admitt that malachy Speakith of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thaultar a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the ſame is a ſacrifice the which is offered in euery place, thei shuld not yet by this, haue their intent. Becauſe that thei must alſo proue, that this is a clenſing ſacrifice for ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes as thei wold haue it. It may be granted affter a good ſence, the ſame ſacrament being called Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chariſtia, becaus in the ſame is yelded thankes to god for ſo gret a benifite as he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in Chr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iſt, It mai, I ſai, he gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that it is a praiſing or tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ksgeuing ſacrifice, but thei haue not by the ſaing of malachy, that it is a cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſing ſacrifice as thei doo meane. And iff thei shuld aske, Affter what ſort th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an, is malachy vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of what ſacrificeſt ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth he?

at the leaſt that thone of them shuld be fals, and yet thei defend them.

               <p>Now let vs proue with the lordes help that ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ither the maſſe nor the ſacrament are ſacrifices for the ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es neither of the liuing, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moch leſſe of the deade. First either thei meane of the hole ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe,<note place="margin">The first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon.</note> as we haue ſaid before, that is to ſay, of all that mixture or els heape and compoſition of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, geſtures and ceremonies, beginning from the <hi>Introibo,</hi> euen vnto thend, or els thei mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ane only of the breade and wine that thei offer, and of the ſacrament. Iff thei meane off the hole maſſe, it can not be a ſacrifice. How is it poſsible that a thing full of ſo many falshods, ſo many ſuperſtitions, ſo many wikedneſſes and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and that ſo many waies robbeth gods honor and Christes, and offendeth him, shuld be a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the liuing and of the deade? Shuld we doo ſacrifice to god with blaſp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hemies?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12148:92"/>
That the maſſe is full of ſuch things, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto we haue diuersly proued it by gods word Iff thei meane only of the breade and wine, and of the ſacrament and not of the hole maſſe, either thei meane of the breade and wine not yet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, or els affter that thei be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated.

There is no dowt but affter the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration folowing their opinion, the bread and the wine be a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. For as thei think, Chriſt all hole is there in bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy and in ſowle, and that there is no more nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread nor wine, but only Christ the which is the trew ſacrifice. Alſo that thei hold that that bread and wine is a ſacrifice before the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how can thei denie it, ſo many praiers, ſecrets and chefely the canon affirming it? The which ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>non in the firſt part praith god that he wold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe that bread and wine, and calleth them holy vntaſted ſacrifices in the plural nomber. And in the ſecond part, that is to ſay in the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> he calleth them a ſacrifice of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecrated, they are become Chriſts body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blood, as they think, and it nedeth not any more to pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>y that they shuld become ſoo, becaus they be allre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ady ſoo becomne.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecrated shuld not be a ſacrifice for ſinnes it is an eaſy thing to proue. For that according to tholy ſcripture, the ſacrifice for ſinnes is that that hath redemed vs. For ſo moch as the redempcion is as moch to ſay as the forgeuenes of ſinnes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Paul as it is writton to the Epheſians and to the Coloſsians:<note place="margin">

That the ſacrament, I ſay, is no ſacrifice in what ſo euer ſort it be a ſacrament. I proue it by Paul in his pi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle to the hebrews,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebre.</hi> 7.8.9.10.</note> The which if the fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the maſſe had but ſupperficially vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they wold neuer ſo boldly haue vttered
<pb facs="tcp:12148:94"/>
that the maſſe or let it be the ſacrament shuld be a ſacrifice. It is writton firſt in that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that there were in the lawe many pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, becaus thei were mortall, but Christ w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho is immortall, hath now theuerlaſting priſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode, and therfor can ſaue for euer all thos that goo to god by him, alweys liuyng to that end that he may intreate god for vs. And he addeth a none affter, that thos preſtes or els byſshops had nede toffer ſacryfyces not only for the ſinnes of the peple but for their own alſo. But it behoued that Chriſt shuld be vndefyled, innocent, the w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich shuld not haue nede eueri dai toffer for him ſelffe, and affter for the peple becauſe he dyd this ones, whan he offred hym ſelffe. For ſo moch as that the lawe appointeth men biſshops that haue weakeneſſys,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.</note> but the word of the oth, that is to ſai the word of god, and of which Dauyd ſpake in the Pſalme, appointeth the ſon for euer conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that is to ſay perfite. By thes wordes, ij thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gs are geuen vs to be vnderſtand. Firſt that none can offer a ſacrifice, that may auaile, (as before god) for ſinnes, except Chriſt that is pure, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſeparated from ſinners perfite and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting bishop, who hath in ſuch ſort offered him ſelff, that the ſacrifice is the preſt him ſelff, and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12148:94"/>
prieſt the ſacrifice it ſelff. For that toffer ſacrifice for ſinnes it behoueth not only that the ſacrifice shuld be cleane, pure and withowt ſpott, but it is neceſſary that he that offereth it, shuld be him ſelff alſo cleane and that he shuld not haue nede toffer for his own ſinnes. It is knowen off old, that among men alſo, whan a thing is preſented by the handes of one that is in diſpleaſure of any gret lord, allthough that the thing be good, yet it shall not be acceptable, becauſe that he which pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſenteth it is not fauored. Iff it be ſo than that he who offereth must be cleane and no ſinner, the preſtes that ſay maſſe, can not offer ſacrifice for ſinnes becauſe thei be vncleane and ſinners. And albeit thei shuld in deede offer Chriſt ones again, that offring could not auaile for ſinnes: becauſe it is nedefull for the bringing to paſſe of ſuch an effect that both thone and thother shuld be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and withowt ſpott, not only the ſacrfice but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo the ſacrificer, a thing that can not be among as many as be but men in the whole world. And for this cauſe it behoued that Christ him ſelff sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be he that shuld offer and make ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to god and no nother but him ſelff, becauſe he alone is without ſinne, and all the reſt be ſinners. Than it geuyth alſo tunderſtand,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:95"/>
that it nedeth not any more to doo ſacrifice for ſinnes becaus he that hath done ſacrifice, Christ, hath ſatisfied, hauing done ones for euer, becauſe it was perfite, being the ſame Chriſt theuerlaſting biſshop that offred him ſelff. Iff that haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed being ones done, what nedeth it to make oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſacrifices or to make againe the ſame at other times? Surely it shuld be ſuperfluos, yea it shuld leſſen the worthines of ſo gret a ſacrifice, for it wold ſeme that it were not ſufficient. So than the maſſes ſacrament is no ſacrifice for ſinnes. Next affter in the viij. chapter he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</note> that Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ſo moch a more excellent preſthode than the old biſshops, as he is a mediator of a more excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtament, the which is made with more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent promiſes. And declaring of what ſort the newe teſtament shuld be, he allegeth the ſaing of the ſcripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 31.</note> that is to ſay, Ieremy, the which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith, this is the testament (that is to ſay, the newe teſtament) which I will make with the hows of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraell, affter thos daies, ſaith the lord I wil geue them my lawes in their mindes, And in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis I will write them, And I will be their god, and thei shal be my peple. And affter a fewe wordes he ſaith, I will be pacified concerning their vnrig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>htuoſnes, and their ſinnes and iniquities I will no
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12148:95"/>
more remember. Thes wordes conclude that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is for vs no nother ſacrifice for ſinnes but that which Christ ones made. God ſaith (who can not lie) that geuing the newe testament he wold in ſuch ſort be mercifull, as he wold no more remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber the ſinnes of his peple, that is to ſay of the tre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we byleuers. The which geueth to vnderſtand th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at he shuld be perfitely and perpetually pacified. Let vs ſee now, for what cauſe he shuld be ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cified? We must ſay, for no nother cauſe but for the mediators ſake of ſuch a teſtament, that is to ſay, for Chriſtes ſake by whom this teſtament was made. Let vs goo on further. How is god pacified by Chriſt, except by the ſacrifice the which he ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, offring him ſelff vnto god for the ſinnes of his peple? Gods anger and his Iustice is by no nother meanes pacified, but becaus (affter a maner of ſpech) he hath wreked him ſelff vpon Christ. Off the which, Eſay ſaith I haue beaten him for the wickednes of my peple. Than let vs ſay affter this ſort, iff god be pacified by Christes ſacrifice, and forgeuith our ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es, It foloweth that there nedeth no nother ſacrifice for ſinnes. For iff he wold haue other ſacrifice for ſinnes he shuld not be, I ſay, perfytely pacifyed, nor, requiring other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce that might ſatisfye for them. he wold not
<pb facs="tcp:12148:96"/>
forget owre iniquities. Surely, he that ſeith not this is very bare of vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>In the ninth chapter shewing the differens be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene thold byſshops a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Chriſt, he ſaith that the leuitical biſshop entred ones in the yeare into that place, the which is called <hi>ſancta ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctorum,</hi> that is the head holy place, not withowt blood, the which he offered for him ſelff and for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the peple. And he ſaith that thos gifftes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſacrifices which were offered, could not make man perfite as perteining to the conſciens. But Christ the biſshop of trewe good things entred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys in to the head holy place with his own blood and gate ther theuerlaſting ranso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And affter he addeth that forgeuenes is not wrought withowt blood sheding? And declaring what shuld be thos head holy placis where into Chriſt entered he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith that, that is heauen, and that he is there ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he may preſently appeare in gods ſight for vs not to be offten offered as the biſshop, (that is to ſay the leuiticall biſshop) off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

For other wiſe it shuld haue bene nedefull that he shuld haue off<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten ſuffered ſins the beginning of the world. But now towards thend of the world, hath he ones appeared to destroy ſinne by the offering of him

And as it is appointed that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ones shall die, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d affter that ſhal iudgement be, ſo Chriſt is ones offered to take a way the ſinnes of man. All this talk doth shewe that neyther the maſſe nor the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a ſacrifice. Firſt it ſaith that thos gifftes and ſacrifices which were offered, could not make man perfite as perteining to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as though he wold ſay, that they could not for giue ſinnes nor perfitely clenſe man, but Christes gifft a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſacrifice is that wich maketh man perfite as perteining to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Which thing the holy gooſt doth witnes, the which foretold that god wold make a newe teſtament. And amo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ngst other things, he ſaith that he wold nomore remember their ſinnes, that is to ſay his peples, and his electis ſinnes. And he addeth that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re forgeuenes off ſinnes is wrought, there nedeth not any more to make other oblacion, that is to ſay to offer other ſacrifice for ſinne. Thes wordes be cannon shot is, ynough to beate down the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le bilding of the maſſe, or els thei be ſwordes yno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ugh to throte cutt hir or vtterly to kill hir. First, he ſaith, that iff the ſacrifices of the lawe had be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12148:99"/>
able to make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfite, the ſelff ſame shuld ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer haue bene ſo offten done again, becaus that they that had ſacrifiſed shuld not haue had any more conſciens of ſinne, being allredy ones clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and purged. Here the text ſaith plainely that it nedeth not to doo again thos ſacrifices which take a way ſinnes and make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfite, the which is all one. Iff the maſſe take a way ſinnes, why doo they ſay it ſo offten? It shuld ſuffiſe to ſay one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatiſfie for them for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shuld be ſaid or that ſay it, and to forgiue their ſinnes. Here the text ſaith that therfor thos ſacrifices were the more offtened becaus they could not take a way ſinnes. Iff they had taken them a way it had not nedid to doo the ſelff ſame againe. The defenders of the maſſe ſay that they doo no nother ſacrifice in the maſſe, but the ſelff ſame that christ did, and that, they doo offten: O goodly ymaginacions. They putt than Christ offten vp on the croſſe we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tingly done and of purpos. The Iewes vnderstode not that Christ was Christ, nor they knewe him not, and therfor they crucified him, as Paul to the Chorinthes, ſaith. And they knowe that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is Christ, and yet they put him ſo many times vp on the croſſe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>cho.</hi> 2.</note> and thei be ſo many times made giltie of his body and bloode, as they ſay maſſes.
<pb facs="tcp:12148:100"/>
It is a godly ſacrifice. What will thei ſay here to the reaſon that the text maketh? that is to ſay, that if thos ſacrifices of the lawe had bene able to take a way ſinnes, thei shuld not haue be done mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re than ones? Iff the maſſe take a way ſinnes why is it ſaid again ſo offten? Than Further, as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſaid. Iff that ſacrifice which chriſt hath made one only time, that is to ſay, whan he offred him ſelff, did than forgiue ſinne, and that only time ſufficed, what nedeth it to make any more ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces for ſinnes? The ſecond ſaing is that we be halo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed by gods will, through the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay, the ſacrifice of chriſtes body ones made. Iff we be halowed, that is to ſay iff we be made clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iff our ſinnes be forgeuen vs through chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſacrifice ones made, wath nedeth it to make a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other ſacrifice, or to offten the ſame? Now the third ſaing, the which re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drith the caus of the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le, that is to ſay, that with one only oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice chriſt hath made perfite, all thos that is to ſay all thelect fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing of the world vnto thend. Iff it be trewe, as withowt dowt it is, what nedeth it any more to make ſacrifice for ſinnes, neither the ſelff ſame nor any other? By that, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ith the text here, be all thos made perfite, that be holied, that is to ſay thelect. Iff thei be made
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12148:100"/>
perfite, that is to ſay, perfitely clenſed, and it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anith that thei want nothing, what nede haue thei of moo ſacrifices? furthermore if the holy go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>oſt which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not lie doo witnes that god through chriſt wold no more remember the ſinnes of his peple, that is to ſay, wold perfitely and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgeue them, what nedeth it any more to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke ſacrifices for ſinnes? To be short, iff where as forgeuenes or ſacrifice for ſinnes is made, there is not any other offring or ſacrifice for the ſame, as the text here ſaith, becaus that that of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes is ynough, the which was made onis, why will we make mo ſacrifices for ſinnes if thei be wholly forgeuen, and of ſuch ſort as god wold ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer remember him any more of them? So that than it is clere and plaine by thes ſo many ſaings of this moſt chriſten and holy pyſtle fore ledged, that we haue no nother ſacrifice for ſinnes but that which chriſt made on the croſſe. And iff it be ſo, it doth in dede folowe of neceſsitie and certenly that neither the maſſe, nor ther ſacrament is a ſacrifice for ſinnes. And if any one wold ſay, how is forgeuenes of all ſinnes w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rought by chriſt, ſeing euery day it is done a newe by repentans? And Chriſt Ieſus him ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lff commandeth vs in the praier which he hath

taught his apoſtles what thei shuld ſay, <hi>Et di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte nobis debita noſtra.</hi> that is to ſay, forgue vs our ſinnes. Iff he hath allredy forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, what nede we any more deſyre that he wold forgeue them vs? To this I anſwer that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul ſayth that by Chriſtes ſacrifyce is forgeuen vs all our ſinnes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2</note> that is to ſay, paſt, preſent, and to come, the which alſo Ihon affirmeth in his <hi>I.</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, whan he ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> that he is the appeaſement of all the ſinnes of the world.

And Eſay, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe ſayth, that god hath layd all our iniquyties vp on him, that is to ſay vp on Chriſt. Thes ſaings of the ſcripture and ſuch other like haue this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning, that is to ſay, that Chriſt Ieſus hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed gods Iuſtyce for the whole ſinnes of thelect, paſt, preſent a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to come. nor god for this reſpect, doth not looke for any other ſatisfaction, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yment, becaus he was perfitely and wholly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for our ſinnes, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt gaue himſelff for a ſacrifyce, ſuffering and dyeng as he dyd, nor the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re was not any other way for us to pacifie god and to ſatisfye him, but this. Vnderſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding affter this ſort the fore ſayd ſaings (the (forgyuenes of all the ſinnes of all thelect of the world, preſent, paſt, and to come) are allredy

forgeuen, nor there is no nother forgeuenes loked for. Becaus that for the ſinnes of the ſame elect the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re is no nother ſatisfaccyon looked for. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſayd, that ſinnes be daily forgeuen by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, this is to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as to vs, that is to ſai, that we doo accept by fayth incloſed within re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentans ſuch forgeuenes, and we doo enter in to the knowlege of gods grace and mercy shewed towards vs thorow Chriſt, bi the forgeuyng of al our ſinnes. Wherfor euen as Chriſt hath onli ſatis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied for thelect, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not for the reſt, to whom his de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ath auaileth not, ſo thelect o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly haue the trew ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>th, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doo knowe the forgiuenes of their ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Chriſt. Wherfor ſpeaking proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, neither the repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nor the faith doo forgeue the ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es, becaus that gods grace o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly or mercy tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row Chriſt Ieſus (that is to ſay, becaus he hath ſatisfied for us) is that that forgeuyth ſinnes. But therfor the forgeuenes of ſynnes is attributed to repentans, and to faith, becaus the ſame faith is that, which knoweth and accepteth ſuch forgeue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and it is a certen aſſurednes of the ſame. And whan we aske euery day in the lords praier that he wold forgeue vs our ſinnes, we doo aske of god rather the knowlege and aſſurednes of ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes, than the forgeuenes it ſelff, of which the

faithfull ought not to dowt, but that it is wroug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ht him in Christ. But we doo aske to knowe ſuch forgiuenes better, and to be more certen of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me. The which knowlege and certentie (being no nother but faith it ſelff) is neuer ſo gret, but it may increaſe and become greater. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for the faithfull Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery day, and as offten as he remembreth him of his ſinnes, deſireth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay, the knowlege a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re certentie of ſuch forgeuenes. Further more Chriſt will that praing daily, we shuld ask forge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenes of our ſinnes, to make vs to knowe that we be ſinners, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that we doo continually offend him. The which thing whan we knowe, first it doth hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vs before god. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it maketh vs know his mercy how gret it is. It hangeth of this kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wlege that we be inflamid more feruently to loue god, to honor him, to reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him, to ſerue him from the hart. And according to his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, to lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue our neyghbor, to doo him good, to forgiue him whan he offendith vs, and to pardon wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges receiued, the which in compariſon, of thos that we doo vnto god, which be withowt no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moſt great, we ought to accownt them no w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rongs and of no w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12148:102"/>
For, iff it were a remeberans of a ſacrifice, it sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be a trewe ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but it is no trewe ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, chefely to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be there preſent, and ſay not the maſſe, therfor it is no reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berans of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. I proue that it is no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becaus that to a trew ſacrament is neceſſary, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaid, and that thei be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d according to that como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaing (and it is of Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <hi>accedit uerbum ad eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum &amp; fít ſacramentum,</hi> that is to ſay, when the worde is Ioined to the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made, it is neceſſary, I ſay, to a trewe ſacrament that the word shuld be Ioined, other wiſe it is no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But how be thei certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whiche be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the maſſe that the wordes with the which thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate, be ſaid by the preſt or not? For ſo moch as thei heare it not, the ſame preſt ſaing it veri ſoff<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tli, in ſuch ſort as none heareth it, except the preſt him ſelff. Therfor to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which heare not, nor u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what is done, nor ſaid, it is no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>A</hi> fewe yeares paſt,<note place="margin">Mark</note> there was in Mantua a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order the which was put in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cage becaus he had celebrated maſſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i yeares, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate.

vnderſtanding what is ſaid? And iff any man wold ſay that there may be a ſacrament, although the wordes of the conſecration shuld neither be hard, nor vnderſtand, ſeing that the childern be baptiſed, which vnderſtand not what is ſaid. To this I anſwer, that there is diuerſitie betwene chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dern a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be of full age, for the childern al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thei neither heare, nor vnderſtand, yet thei may and ought to be baptiſed by gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And this is taken owt of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. But thei of full age, ought not to be baptiſed, except thei vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that which is ſaid. Yea bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time in full age requireth faith, and the confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame. And iff at any time it shuld be done otherwiſe, that is to ſay, iff it shuld not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, it shuld not be vnto him trewe baptim. So moch more we shall ſay of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of bread and wine (the which none vſe butt thei of full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge) that thei be no ſacrament, if the wordes be not ſpoken, and vnderſtand, with which wordes thei be conſecrated, that is to ſay appointed to an holy vſe, and become a ſacrament. For this cauſe in old time the wordes of the conſecration were ſaid with a lowd voice, to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that euery one might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what was ſaid, ſo that, ſeing the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the maſſe is no trewe ſacrament, it is

no memory of a ſacrifice Further more we muſt knowe, that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not an abſolute thing but is a thing that hath reſpect to a nother thing, that is to ſay, to the vſe to which it is appointed. And whan ſuch vſe is taken a way, it can not be properly called a ſacrament. The trewe vſe of the ſacrament is, that it shuld be diſtributed to the multitude. And to this end it is conſecrated, that is to ſay, appointed. Let vs ſee how the ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or vſed it, whan he inſtituted it. It is ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ten that he gaue it not to one only, but to all his diſciples, and ſaid vnto them, that thei shuld doo as he tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght them, and did him ſelff. And how did he? He ſaid not only ouer the bread and wine, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the conſecration, as the prieſtes doo, which ſeme to make an inchantment, but he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them that thei all shuld take, and eate, the bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ad, and drink the wine. He did all this, and ſaid that thei ought to doo as he had done. It behoueth iff it shuld be a ſacrament to doo all that which Christ ſaid and commanded, and not part. But now the Prieſt, beſide that it is not vnderſtand what he doth, he doth not deale the ſacrament to the peple, but taketh it him ſelff alone, and yet he ſaith that he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. And he calleth that receiuing with the mowth, that is to ſay, taking
<pb facs="tcp:12148:104"/>
the bread, and wine, he calleth it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aking and doing abuſingly. It is called a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on whan many doo partake of one thing, not wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one by him ſelff alone, doth take the whole, as is done in the priuat maſſe. By the which thi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ng we may truli ſay that that ſacrament of the maſſe, is no trew ſacrament. Wherfor if Paul, for that diſorder that the corinthians did vſe (as it is writton in the <hi>1.</hi> to the ſame corinthians) which was,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cho.</hi> 11.</note> that one taried not for another (and it was but a ſmall fawt in compariſon of this) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, that that which they did, was no eating of the lordes ſupper: what shall we ſay of this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the which is committed not one, but ſo many abuſes, and where the whole trewe vſe of the lords ſupper, is changed? Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that all shuld take it. And here in the maſſe the prest eateth and drinketh vp all alone. My reaſon ſtandeth in this. The vſe of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is of the ſubstance of the ſame ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And where the v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe is not to which it was appointed, there the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in deed, is not. The vſe of the lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or of the thankes geuing is not only to ſay the wordes ouer the bread and the wine, but it is that many shuld take it, and eate the one and drink the other, as Christ appointed Than
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:12148:104"/>
where ſuch vſe is not, there is no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for he ſaid to many. Eate yow, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d drink yow. And why is not this done in the priuate maſſe, but rather the cleane contrary? For one alone that is to ſay, the prest, doth take the host and the cupp. So that than it is no trewe ſacrament. I will geue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of baptim, to thentent that euery one may vnderſtand how the ſacrament ſtandeth in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, And whan the vſe is ceaſed it is no more a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The water of baptim is no ſacrament, but for that time that it waſsheth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is put vp on the body, ſaing thes wordes, I baptiſe the in the name of the father, the ſonn and the holy gooſt Amen. Let that water fall in to another veſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, affter that the creature be baptiſed, it is no more baptime, but is as any other water, this is plaine. Euen ſo I ſay of the ſacrament of than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ksgeuing, whilest that it is delt, and diſtributed, it is a ſacrament, but that which is lefft of the bread and wine, is no more a ſacrament, but it may be eaten and dronken as other bread and wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, becaus it is no more appointed to ſuch vſe. So I ſay of thos crommes of breade that fall vp on the grownd, that thei be no ſacrament. I know th<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at of this my talk many things doo folow, the which will ſeme inconuenient. And amongſt

I ſay thus, becaus it ſemith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me according to gods word, that it shuld be ſo, that is to ſay, that as whan the vſe of baptime is ceaſed, the water is no more a ſacrament, ſo whan the vſe of the thankesgeuing is ceaſed, that is to ſay, whan it is no more taken and dealt, eaten and drunck, it is no more a ſacrament, I meane, eaton and drunck in common, for ſo moch as the lords ſupper is not a doing of one particular man, but of many men. And becaus that in the maſſe we ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue not this vſe, but the preſt alone taketh that oſt, and cupp, withowt communicating them to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I ſay it is no trewe ſacrament. And iff it be no ſacrament, it is neither any memory of ſacrifice, the which thei wold haue proued.</p>
               <p>But admitt that there neuer had bene neither thone, nor thother, of thes ij. diſorders, what will thei ſay to this that none of the priſtes in this
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12148:106"/>
time, doth perfitely make the ſacrament accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own doctrine? I proue it thus, They them ſelues ſay, that none can work, and make the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t except it be a prist, and he that is no prist, can not conſecrate, But to be a prist is neceſſary that he shuld be conſecrated by a biſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, the which in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shuld geue him the mark, the which mark, is a certen ſpirituall vertu geuen by the biſshop. Standing this ther do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he who is not a biſshop, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thes <hi>2.</hi> pointes be of the holi ſcripture. For as, to the first, we haue that Paul and Barnabas, as it is writton in thactis of thapostles,<note place="margin">

But it is worthy of noting, that the defenders of the maſſe ſai, that the maſſe is gods inſtitution, for the ſacrament is the chefe of the ſame maſſe, and that it is trewe, that the maſſe was augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d increaſed bi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and at diuers times, yet for all that, thei ſai, that the maſſe, for becaus of the chefe part, is gods inſtitution. And thos additions be for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſshing of it, neuertheles, the ſubſtance which is the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was made bi chriſt. And it ſemith to me, that thei wold ſai of the maſſe, as of a great riuer. As for example of the poo, the which
<pb facs="tcp:12148:110"/>
at the head,<note place="margin">The poo is a great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in Italie as Thamis is in England.</note> where it beginneth, is very lytle, and is no better than a lytle ſpring, but becaus there comyth in to it many other ryuers, therfor it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comyth affterward great, neuertheleſſe it kepith the name of Poo. So is it of the maſſe. But this talk is nothing worth. Our queſtyon is not now of the name, that all that gathering is called maſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe, and the ſame ſacrament shuld be alſo called Maſſe, as it is called Poo, not only the ſpring whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re it beginnyth, but all thos ryuers gathered to gether in one great ryuer, which affter, is all to gether called Poo. We ſpeake here of the whole maſſe, and we ſay that all the maſſe that is to ſay all that myxture of wordes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſo mani ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyes, was not inſtituted by Chriſt, but by many Popys and that Chriſt made no more of the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le maſſe, but the ſacrament only. And ſeing that we haue putt the ſimilitude of the maſſe, and of the Poo, we will ſay, that allthough, that all that compoſition or gathering to gether of ryuers in to one great riuer, shuld be called Poo, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we shall neuer ſai that all that gret and large ryuer, shuld growe owt of that litle ſpring but we will ſay that it groweth of diuers ryuers, that is to ſay the gret Poo, And that all the Poo, doth not growe of the lytle ſpring, but only a ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:12148:110"/>
part of it. So all the maſſe came not from Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, but only that lytle part of the conſecracion. Yea according to their own opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt was added by plaine men.</p>
               <p>It is playne, that taking alſo this word Maſſe, for the ſacrament, that thei make, it was neuer ordeyned by Chriſt, nor vſed by his apoſtles. For the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that Chriſt ordeined, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtles vſed, was of a nother ſort, moch differing and diuers from theirs. Firſt, the conſecracion was made, after a nother ſort. Becaus Chriſt ſaid the words of the conſecracion a lowd, and dyd pronownce them plainely that all vnderſtode.</p>
               <p>Thei, ſay them ſofftly, that none heareth them, but he that ſaith the maſſe. And how can it be a ſacrament, to them that vnderstond not, nor hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re not the wordes, ſeing a thing can not be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, except the wordes be hard, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand? Furthermore Chriſt ſaid not thos wordes, with mind to change the ſubſtance of the breade and wine in to his body and blood, as thei think, but to appoint thone and thother, to be ſignes in his rememberans, as his wordes doo shewe. So that ſeing thei haue not the ſame meaning, that
<pb facs="tcp:12148:111"/>
Christ had, nor will not doo the ſame, that Chriſt did, but a nother thing, we muſt nedes ſay that ſuch a ſacrament, is not Chriſtes ſacrament, but a thing fownd owt by them ſelues, made affter their own maner, and not according to Chriſtes institution.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the ſacrament which Christ did institute, was inſtituted to thentent that it shuld be a ſpirituall ſupper, delt to many, and he gaue it to all. Thei doo it not affter this ſort, but the prest only taketh that his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and giueth it not to other, nor this thing is no communion, becaus a communion is, whan many doo partake of one thing, and not whan one alone vſeth it. So that ſeing thei doo not as Christ did, or rather as he commanded that it shuld be done, their is no trewe ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as alſo we haue proued in the ſecond chapter of this part. Nor it was not instituted by Chriſt, but by mans inuencion. Let them than vnderstand this their maſſe, either for all the hole gathering, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Introibo</hi> to the <hi>Ite miſſa eſt,</hi> or els for the ſacrament only, becaus it is no trewe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I ſay, that it is not gods ordinance but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12148:111"/>
mans. And being mans ordinans, yet thei make it a ſacrifice, and a woshipping of god, againſt his expreſſe commandment, who will not be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with the inuention of men, as allredy we haue ſo offten ſayd.</p>
               <p>There remaineth now to ſee from whens this name of Maſſe had the beginning? Certen ſay, as Maſter William Durant in the proheme of the iiij. part of his reaſon geuing of gods ſeruice, that this Name Maſſe is ſome time a nowne collectiue ſome time a nowne proper.<note place="margin">

Becaus the faithfull peple, by the mistery of the prieſt, the which doth Chriſtes office betwene god and men doth ſend their praiers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to god. Some time this name maſſe, is a nowne proper, and doth ſignifie Chriſt, firſt ſent, from the father to vs, and ſent from vs to the father, to thentent that before him, he might intreate for vs, Albeit for shortnes, I doo not recite all his opinion. Some other, as Ihon
<pb facs="tcp:12148:112"/>
rewcklin a man very well lerned in the hebrew to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, ſaith, that the maſſe is no greke name nor la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tin but hebrewe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is as moch to ſai, as ſacrifice. And now our maſſemongers, wold that the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe shuld be a ſacrifice for ſinnes. Otherſome ſay, as Polidor virgil of vrbine, that Miſſa, is as moch to ſay as geuing leaue to depart, or licenſing the peple that thei may goo their way, that is to ſay-that licence and leaue is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, that thei may depart, for ſo moch as, in old time no man oug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht to depart from the holy things, thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent, except licens were geuen them. And Miſſa is as moch to ſay, as miſsio, or dimiſsio, a licenſing, or geuing leaue to depart, becaus that being ended, the peple is licenſed to goo at their pleſure to their howſes. He ſaith beſides, many things vp on this matter, but becaus I know that this name hath an abhominable ſignification, I litle deſire to ſerch any further for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſo vngracios a name.

The vſe of ſo many garments, and of the conſecracion of the ſame, is the ordinance of pope Stephan the firſt, and came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewis. The corporaſsis was the diuiſe of Sixtus the firſt. the chaliſes firſt were made of wood. Zepherinus the pope did inſtitute that thei shuld miniſter in veſſels of glaſſe.

For this cauſe it was ordeined, that thei shuld miniſter in ſiluer or in gold. And iff thei could not be gotten, at the leaſt in tinne, and not in any other metall, becaus of the euill ſauor of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther metalls. Some ſay that pope Vrbanus the firſt did inſtitute this. And what meaneth it, that the Apoſtles, nor the primatiue church, did not vſe ſo gret pomp in veſſels? what ſuperſtitions be theſe?

                  <hi>Vt quid baptiſantur pro mortuis?</hi> This was by error, and it was not well done. So we will ſay of the ſuper, that it was inſtituted for the liuing, and not for the dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, becaus that the deade can not vſe it in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes rememberans, nor eate it, nor drinck it. Some man will ſay, the deade can not vſe it, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing may vſe it for the deade. I wold haue of thes men that thei wold alledge me the caus why this ſacrament, may rather be vſed for the deade, than baptiſme?

Why than shall the holy ſupper help for the ſinnes off the dead? It is certen, that where the holy ſupper is ſpoken off, there is not ſo offten and ſo expreſſe mencion made, that it shuld be taken in forgeuenes off ſinnes, as where the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ſpoken of. I meane not, by this my ſaing, to affirme that by baptiſme ſinnes be forgeuen.

And that iff the lords ſupper shuld auayle for the deade, baptiſme alſo shuld auaile, but baptiſme doth not auaile for the deade, wherfor alſo the ſacrament of thanks giuing doth not auaile.</p>

               <p>A nother abuſe more manifest than the reſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> that is to ſay, that euery man may more eaſily ſee that it is an abuſe, and it is this, that is to ſay, that there is marchandiſe made of it, and ſuch as is to be merueled at. And this marchandiſe off the maſſe among all the other, hath one ſingular pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uilege, becaus that in other there is made yet a certen differens off dayes, and there is had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſpect, to the feaſtes, to the places, chefely holy. But in this, how moch the feaſt is gretter
<pb facs="tcp:12148:127"/>
and more ſolempne, ſo moch the fayer is made more ſolempne. Yea then thei trafficke and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie. How moch more holy the place is, ſo moch the rather this marchandiſe is made in it. We may ſee that the Innes do make no holydayes, but thei labor alike, on all dayes. Thei lodge the wayfarers and alſo other that come thether, as well on holy dayes as other, nor thei make no differens betwene one daye, and a nother, but thei make all a like. It is trewe, but yet thei doo make a certen differens, at the leaſt of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becaus thei occupie not euery where. Who if that Innholder, or Tauerner, that wold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an Inn, or a tauerne in any church? None ſurely. But the maſſmarchantes haue not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but how moch the holier the place is cown<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, ſo moch the willinglier the maſſe is there bought and ſold. This excellent priuilege with many other withowt nomber, the maſſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants haue obteined off Antichriſt, who hath all powr ouer ſuch things. And long a goo the time was, thatt this marchandiſe was ſold very dere, but from certen yeares hetherto, it is beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me dogg cheape, and a maſſe is geuen for a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prat, yea and for leſſe, according to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to the parſons, that knowe how to bye.

This is it that hath made rich the pristes, the frires and the monkes, that maketh men fownd chapells, bilde churches, colleges, howſis, mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, off friers abbaies, commandries, and to beshort it is that, that hath made rich the ſtate called eccleſiasticall. It hath meruelosly liffted it vp in the world. The maſſe is that which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uith ſo gret reuenewes to the moſt reuerend Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinals, and which maketh them ride vp on thes faire mulis, couered with veluet, with thos faier redd hattis, the which doo ſignifie the order off the Seraphins, burning in charitie and in godly loue. This is the ſignificacion, ſome ſay, off red hattes which (the maſſe I ſay) maketh to ride with ſo many horſes, with ſo gret a company of gentlemen, as though thei were Dukes, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that whan thei goo to the conſistory, the shalmes are plaied on to them, on the battleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts off the caſtell ſent Angelo, and thei ryde with ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry gret mirth, pomp, and triumph. The maſſe maketh all thes things to be done, for iff it were not, ſurely there shuld want ſuch pomp, and gretnes. Off the Biſshops, oh how many things might I ſay iff I wold, but I must leaue to other to ſay their part. I wil ſay only this, that it made them wholly forget their office, and hath made
<pb facs="tcp:12148:128"/>
them attend to certen ſcornworthy baggagis, as to Chriſten the bells, to conſecrate the ſtones, and the wallis, with more indeuor and diligens, than iff thei shuld baptiſe the ſonnes off a King, and an Emperor, and than iff thei shuld miniſter the thanksgiuing, to all the Monarchies off the world, and all this to giue credite to the maſſe. I ſpeake not off the preaching off Gods word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is a thing for poore men. This Maſſe is the mother off purgatory, the which purgeth the purſes, the garners, the howſes, the ſellers, ſo that there is no brome in the world, that ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth ſo wel an hows as this purgatory doth. To tell yow at fewe wordes this abuſe is ſo open and ſo large, and geueth vs ſo moch to ſay, that in an whole yeare it wold not be ended.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> But among all the other properties and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the maſſe hath, this is one moſt ſingular, that it leadeth men a way from Gods word. Here there nedeth not to bring any other than expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to proue it. Let there be one that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and let him be in the midſt off his ſermon,

iff there come furth a prieſt apparelled redy to ſay maſſe, a grett part off the hearers turning their backes to the preacher wil ronn affter the prieſt to heare maſſe. This is an aſſuered grownd, that the gret part off the peple haue more deuocion to the maſſe, than to Gods word and the holy goſpell. And what els doth Sathan deſire, but by ſuch meanes, to drawe a way the peple from the holy goſpell, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods word? The ſauior ſaith,<note place="margin">

And the maſſe carieth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from Gods word and the holy goſpel, and conſequently from their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion. And iff there were not any other abuſe in the maſſe but this, it ought to be fled as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish inuencion. And who could euer ſett owt this abuſe as it is worthy? This is the caus that Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath ſought by ſo many ways, to deck it a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make it faire, affter the ſort off an harlot to intiſe the peple to whore with a ſpirituall and a ſowles whordom, which withowt compariſon doth moch more diſpleaſe God, than the fleshly.

(I ſpeake of the <hi>10.</hi> commandements which thei call the morall lawe) is diuided as men knowe in to <hi>2.</hi> tables, the firſt, and the ſecond. The firſt is of the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, and regardeth directly Gods honor and glory.</p>
               <p>The ſecond doth teach and inſtruct man to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward his neighbor. Thes things to all thos that haue knowlege in the holy writing, be plaine. And becaus that the honor and glory of God is withowt compariſon of more importans,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:130"/>
than thos things that reſpectt man, we ought to ſay that the ſinnes that be againſt the firſt table, be heuier and gretter, than thos that be againſt the ſecond, becaus that thei be directly againſt gods honor. And therfor infidelitie, Idolatry and blaſphemy, which be ſinnes againſt the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be greter and heuier ſinnes, than thefft, than adultery and the reſt which be against the ſecond table, and againſt men. This is with owt dowt. Let vs goo further. We ought to knowe alſo that euen as among the ſinnes of the ſecond table, the one is greter and more weighty than thother. as for example, adultry is gretter ſinne than ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thefft, and one murther is gretter than a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the murthering of the father, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a gretter ſinne than the murthering of a nother parſon, So among the ſinnes that be aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the firſt table, one is gretter than a nother.

A great iudgement, by the which is shewed, what man can doo iff god forſake him, and doth not light him with his word and with
<pb facs="tcp:12148:131"/>
the light of his ſpirite, becaus he knoweth not what is to be done, and in Gods things he doth all contrary. Withowt dowt the gentiles did greatly ſinn in their vnbyleffe, committing Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and blaſpheming their maker, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonding thei ſinned by ignorans, nor thei could not doo otherwiſe, hauing not the light of the ſcripture. But the Hebrewes, who had the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Gods word cleare and open, did ſinn mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re greuosly in their vnbilefe, committing Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and blaſphemy, than the heathen. For it was euen as he that ſeith the ditch, and yet of purpos and willingly falleth in to it. It is plaine that he doth moch more ſinne, who hath thexpreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandment of the lord, and knoweth his will, and noth withſtanding yet doth againſt ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and will, than he that knoweth it not,<note place="margin">

               <p>And for this caus the Hebrewes whan thei

worſshipped the calff in the deſert, they did moch more greuosly ſinn than the heathen who did honor the Idols, for ſo moch as that not long before, thei were cowncelled by God him ſelff who gaue them the lawe and commanded them that thei shuld not make any ymage to honor and yet thei made it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods expreſſe commandment. And ſo as many other times as thei haue committed Idolatry (as we haue in the bookes of the Kings and of the Prophetes) thei haue moch more offended God and more greuosly ſinned than the heathen. And the Idolatry and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of his own peple, was more abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in Gods ſight, and did more prouoke him to anger, than that of the heathen.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12148:132"/>
And this becaus his peple had the knowlege off God and were taught with his word the trew worship off God, that is to ſay how thei ought to worship him, and honor him, the other peple were not ſoo, the which ſinned by ignorans. It doth fitly folow alſo that iff there shall be fownd Idolatry among the Christians, who be now Gods peple, that that shal be more abhominable before God, than any other, not only of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then but alſo of the Hebrewes.

To him that hath redd the ſtories of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes, this that I ſay is plaine. Iff it be ſo than that where the knowlege of God, of Chriſt, of the threw worship is greater, Idolatry, vnbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe and blaſphemy be more greuos ſinnes than where there is not ſo gret and ſo clere knowlege. Surely iff we shall find thes ſo greuos ſinnes in the Chriſten peple, we muſt of neceſsitie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that thei shall more diſpleaſe God, and shall be more hatefull vnto him, than all the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, all the vnbilefes, and all the blaſpemies off the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea and off the Hebrewiſsh peple too.

The body off S. Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of aquitan, the Seneaſes ſay, that it is in an abbey in their territory, and thei shewe it. And yet a nother body is shewed, in a certen vale called, S. Iames vale, vnder the rule of griſones and there is done to it gret reuerens. It is wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipped, thei ronn to it for raine, for faire we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other buſines. How many heades of S.

Iohan Baptiſt be shewed in diuers placis? And what ſcornes be thes of the Chriſten religion? What madneſſes, what dulneſſes be thes, that men shuld looſe the comon ſenſe and shuld haue leſſe Iudgement, than the brute beaſtes? So we could iff we wold tell yow a gret nombrer of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke abuſes. This corrupcion can not be ſcuſed for it is to plaine. Let vs goo on further, Is it Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to worship the Imagis, to knele before them, to ſtick candels before them, to ſett lampes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to call vp on them, to make vowes to them, to hang torches, tapers, cloth corne, garments, eyes, handes, heades, leggs, ſometime off waxe, ſomtime off ſiluer, before them, to hang before them, Imagis off men, off wemen, of yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, off oxen and off hors? Is it Idolatry, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe I ought to ſaye, plaine doltiſshnes, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue greter deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one Image or picture, than to a nother, off the ſelff ſame ſaint or ſaintes? As for example, more to that off S. Loreto, than to that off the Annunciation in Florence, and to think that the one shuld doo more miracles than the other? Is it Idolatry to make the Image of the Trinitie the which is an high ſpirite, that can not be painted, nor carued by any maner off meanes? And yet againſt Gods commandement
<pb facs="tcp:12148:135"/>
thei paint it, and carue it, in the shape of certen ſtrange monsters, that is to ſay, ſomtimes in the shape of a man, with <hi>3.</hi> heades, ſomtimes in the faſshon of <hi>3.</hi> men with <hi>2.</hi> leggs only, and in this forme thei worship it, and make their vowes to it. What will thei ſay here? will thei defend thes manifeſt abuſes, with that their distinction, that thei make off <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Hiperdulia</hi> and <hi>Latria?</hi> This thing meaneth a nother maner of thing than Dulia and Hiperdulia. I will not declare thes wordes and their diſtinction, the which I knowe well ynough fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s it cometh. Iff there were not worldy gaine here in this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, their Images, and heir Dulias and Hiper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulias wold ſoone ceaſe. It can not be denied but among the Chriſten peple there be many Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, moch vnbilefe many blaſphemies and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegis. Sacrilege is to robb the holy things. What is more holy than Gods and Christes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? This is to cleere. Neuertheles, among all the reſt, as there be many Idolatries, (I will not ſay withowt nomber) that of the maſſe, is the greteſt and the chefe, not only becaus the host and the cup, be worshipped in ſtead of Chriſt, not being certen that the ſame Chriſt is there, as before in

the Cannon we haue proued, in that part where their conſecracion is ſpoken off, and as alſo we will better proue, in the ſermon in thend of this booke, but moch more becaus thei will, that all the Maſſe shuld be a worship of God, ſaing that it is a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the liuing, and of the dead, in the which God is honored, yea Chriſt him ſelff is offered to God, wherfor it doth well folow, that it is a moſt gret Idolatry, for ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch as, that Idolatry is not only where any viſible ydoll, or ymage is honored, but euery wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip the which is made vnto God withowt his word, is Idolatry, for becaus that no ſuch wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip is trewe worship, nor pleaſith God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is to him abhominacion. for ſo moch then as that God will not as before we haue allredy offten told, that we shuld honor him affter our own mind, and as it ſemeth good to vs, but will that we shuld honor him, as he doth teach and command vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 29. <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</note> as we haue in Eſay and Chriſt alleageth him ſelff in ſanct Mathew: We haue be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore allredy proued that the Maſſe is mans inuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion, therfor ſeing we will make it a worship as we doo, yea the chefe of the Christian religion, we must conclude that it is an Idolatry becaus that it is a worship withowt Gods word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12148:136"/>But let vs ſee off what ſort off Idolatry it is? First there be many deceites, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt, there is this, that thei perſuade the peple, as an article off their faith, not only that Chriſt is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in that hoſt, and likewiſe in the cupp, and make them honor the one, and thother, but that he is there, as gret, and as thick, as he was vp on the wood off the croſſe, and that he is wholly, not only in that litle hoſt, but in euery part off the hoſt and the wine, and that he is in heauen, and in earth, and in all places where the hoſtes be conſecrated. And thei perſuade that there is the whole court off heauen, and that there is no more bread nor wine, but only the withco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes, off thone and off the other. For their ſubſtancis, thei be tranſſubſtanciated, that is to ſay, changed in to the ſubſtance off the body, and blood, off Christ. All the which things, and many other, thei haue fownd owt, to geue the more credite to this their maſſe, to thentent, that the peple shuld haue more deuocion to it. Thei haue fownd that it is good for euery thing, and that it hath ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tews innumerable, and thei haue geuen vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo many other things off this Maſſe, that it is a wonder. Further more, as we haue proued in the former diſcorſe that we haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12148:136"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Introibo,</hi> to the end, how many fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedes, how many ſupersticions, wickedneſſes, and blaſphemies be in this Maſſe? There Chriſt is robbed off his honor many wayes, Yea he is euel ſpoken off, the forgeuenes off ſinnes, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the ranſoming, the intreating, and the ſaluacion is attributed to other things. Do yow not think that a moſt greuos ſacrilege is commit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted whan his glorios titles be directly pluckt from him, and his honor and glory taken away? The which outrages ſo open and ſo plaine, were neuer committed in any Idolatry off the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or off the Iewes.</p>
               <p>And to perceiue better that which we doo ſay, yow muſt vnderſtand, that euen as Ieſus Chriſt is Gods beſt beloued, nor that the ſame God loueth any other thing ſo moch as Chriſt his only begoten ſonn (yea I ſpeake off him in that he is man) nor no nother man off the world can be reconciled, nor return in to Gods fauor but by Chriſt, yea no maner thing, whether it be prayer, thankes geuing, allmes or any other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner off work is acceptable, or thankfull to God, iff not by Chriſt, nor we can not haue any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner off benifice, perteining to ſaluacion, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Chriſt, ſo on the contrary there can not be
<pb facs="tcp:12148:137"/>
done a thing more hatefull, more diſpleaſing to god, and that shuld be more abhominable to him, than to doo againſt Chriſt, and to robb his honor and glory. And the more a thing is aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt Chriſt, the more it diſpleaſeth him, for ſo moch as nothing pleaſeth him but thorow chriſt. And becaus there was neuer in the world any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry the which ſo directly, and ſo many waies did robb Chriſt, as this maſſe, we muſt conclude that no ydolatry, although it were moſt grett, was euer ſo abhominable before god as this. Let vs take the ydolatries of the heathen, it is clere that thei had not the knowlege of Chriſt, and therfor could not robbe him in ſuch ſort, as the maſſe doth, in the which chefely it made expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe mencion of him in many places. The Idolatries likewiſe of the Hebrewes thei haue not ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſely taken the honor from chriſt as the maſſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th. Let vs beginn with the Idolatry that thei did in the deſert, whan thei honored the calff, it was in dede a heuy ſinne, not withſtanding it was do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne by want of conſideracion, with an vprowr, and rage of the peple, And Aaron vnwillinglie and for feare agreid vnto them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> as it is writton in exodus. Nor that peple had not ſo moch know lede of Chriſt as we, there was made no mencion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12148:137"/>
of forgeuenes of ſinnes, of ſatisfacion, of ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or of the things belonging to Chriſtes offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce. Nor Chriſt was not robbed of his honor, ſo many wayes as in the maſſe he is. And ſoo let vs goo thorowall the Idolatries of that peple, as well of the tribe of Iuda, as of the x. tribes. The x. tribes did worship ij. goldin calues, made by king hieroboam, thone was in Bethell,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12.</note> and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Dann. This was ydolatry for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Than alſo becaus thei worshipped car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued things, that is to ſay, the ij.

Thei did worship alſo the ymage of baal vnder king Achab, as it is writton in the boke of the kings, in Helias time the Prophet,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 16.18</note> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thei did ſacrifice vnto it. The tribe of Iuda, and the tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be of beniamin, thei alſo haue many times do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne ydolatry, the which allthough that thei fawted more committing ydolatry than the x. tribes, becaus thei had gretter knowlege of god, being better inſtructed, and taug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht, in gods worship and in his lawe,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:138"/>
becaus thei had more plenty off Prophetes, And alſo becaus with them was Gods doctrine more pure, and leſſe corrupted, than among the <hi>10.</hi> tribes, neuertheles, thei had not for all that ſo moch knowlege off God, and off Chriſt as we, nor thei did not ſo many wayes directly offend Chriſt, as thes do in the maſſe, as it appeareth plainely by all this whole diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Seing it is thus than, that God and Christ is more offended in the Maſſe, than in all the other Idolatries that euer were in the world, whether it be off the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or off the Hebrewes, the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluſion foloweth that we deſired to proue. And for more clerenes, or els euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce off this our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, let vs gather to gether in a Somm all our talk made in this chapter.<note place="margin">An Epilog. or short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſal off the reaſon.</note> And let vs ſay, that Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or els fals worship, in the which God and Chriſt be more, and off moo ſortis robbed off their honor, and is among that peple that haue more knowlege off the ſame God and Chriſt, than the other, that Idolatry (I ſay) is greter ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and abhominacion, than all the other. This ſayng is ſo clere, that none can reaſonably denye it. But the Maſſe is a fals worship, and an ydolatry, in the which Gods, and Chriſtes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, is more, and affter moo ſortes robbed than
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12148:138"/>
in my other, and is among that peple that haue more knowlege of God, and Chriſt, than the reſt, for it is among the Christian peple, therfor that is the greteſt ſacrilege, and the moſt abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that euer was in any maner off world. That the maſſe is ſuch a worship and ſuch an Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latry in the which Gods, and Chriſtes honor is more robbed, than in any other that euer was, we haue by our former talk plainely ynough proued it. Firſt that it is a fals worship, we haue proued it, becaus it is fownd owt by men, and further, becaus the oſt, and the cup, be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and that Gods honor and Chriſtes is robbed many wayes, we haue alſo proued. Firſt becaus he that ſayth the maſſe doth vſurpe Chriſtes offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce as wel becaus he offereth Chriſt him ſelff to God, as the fauorers off the maſſe confeſſe and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme, the which thing (that is to ſay to offer the ſame Chriſt) belonged only to him, who as the chefe prieſt hath offred him ſelff vnto God, vp on the wood off the croſſe. Further alſo, becaus that he, that is to ſay, the Maſſe ſayer, is made intreater betwene the peple and God, the which thing is Chriſtes office only. Thirdly, becaus it maketh the Maſſe to be a ſacrifice for ſinnes, the which in like ſort belongeth to Chriſt only, as
<pb facs="tcp:12148:139"/>
likewiſe we haue proued in the ſecond chapter of this fourth part. The fautors, of the maſſe wold that the ſame shuld forgiue the ſinnes of the liuing, and the deade, shuld ſatisfie for them, and that it shuld ſaue men, all the which things belong only to gods grace thorow Chriſt, and be the proper offices of Chriſt, and thei be not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature. This maſſe robbeth from the croſſe, from the paſsion, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the blood, from the death, and from the beriall of Chriſt, becaus that that which Chriſt did, with thes things, thei wold that the maſſe shuld doo it. Surely, the maſſe, as thei think worketh thes effects. And what is it to robb chriſt of his honor, iff this be not? That is to ſay, to plucke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the glory of the priſthode, of the intreatorship, of the only ſacrifice, and to be short, of the only redemer, and ſauer? We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſene how many falſedes, how many ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, wickedneſſes, and blaſphemies be therein, shall it not than be a ſacrilege, shall it not be an abhominacion aboue all other ſacrileges and ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hominacions ſeinge it is an heape of ſacrilegis a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d abhominacions? Yes ſurely shall it. It is therfor clere and plaine, that the maſſe is the greteſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and the greteſt abhominacion, that euer was in any world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:12148:139"/>It is an eaſy things to proue, by the things all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy ſpoken, that it is the gret miſtery of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, And it foloweth neceſſarily, that iff the maſſe be the greteſt ſacrilege, and abhominacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euer was in the world, that alſo it is the gret miſtery of Antichriſt, called by Paul, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenci of it, the miſtery of iniquitie.

And this he doth chefely aff<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter ij. ſortis. One is openly that euery man ſeith. The other is ſecretly and moch wors. The open waie is with the perſecucions that he doth aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, afflicting them, tormenting them and killing them, by meanes of the princes of the worlde, and as it is ſaid, with the ſecular powr. For ſurely thes ſame be no nother but the Armes, of Antichriſt, with the which he fighteth againſt Chriſt, although that the poore princes be not aware of ſuch things, but be deceiued by the Antichriſtians, that
<pb facs="tcp:12148:140"/>
be in their cowrtis. And this maner off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Chriſt, although it be open to all men, neuertheles Antichriſt being full off the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries off iniquities, and off deueliſsh crafftines, with meruelos and moſt craffty pretenſis, and colors, maketh it to ſeeme, to be of a nother ſort than it is. For although this maner of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt, is all wholly wicked, and Satanike, yet neuertheles, he geueth to vnderſtand, that it is a godly, and a religios thing, and that it is, a defence of Chriſten religion, and a keping of it, perſuading that Chriſtes ſeruantes be heretikes, and that the faithfull Christians be Lutheranes. He geueth to vnderſtand that he is Chriſtes liff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, yea, that he is a God on earth, and not withſtanding he procureth as moch as he can, that Chriſtes doctrine shuld not come in to the light, becaus it is that that diſcouereth him, and maketh him open to the world. And he wold not be knowen for him that he is, that is to ſay, for Antichrist, which is as moch to ſay, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes chefe aduerſary. Doo yow not think that this is a newe maner off making warr againſt a prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce, to ſerch by all meanes to beate him downe, to kill all his, and to ouerthrowe him vtterly? And than off the other part to giue to vnderſtand,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12148:140"/>
and make the world bileue, that he workith for him, that is to ſay, to mainteine him in his ſtate, and to kepe him in his dominion? What ſay yow? Doth not this ſeme to be a fine art, to make warr vpon one wit his moſt might, and openly to ſeke to ouerthrow him vtterly, and of the other ſide, to make byleue to the world that euery thing that he doth, he doth it to ſerue him and to doo him pleaſure? Euen ſo doth Antichriſt againſt Chriſt. For he withſtondeth him, he is his chefeſt and moſt mortal enemy, and neuertheles he ſaith he is his Leefftena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and doth euery thing to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Chriſt, and to mainteine his kingdom, that is to ſay, his church. Why doo yow not now at length open your eyes Oh Christians? Is it not ynough that hetherto yow haue bene ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with ſo great loſſe deceiued? Riſe vp, o God, and iudge thine own caus. Suffer not any longer, o lord, ſo great diſorder that the peple shuld be of this ſort handled.<note place="margin">

               <p>The other way of making warr againſt Chriſt, is more hidden, and ſecret, and is not ſene as the firſt, but it is withowt compariſon moch wors, and more hurtfull, becaus that the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb facs="tcp:12148:141"/>
hurteth the bodies, but this ſecond hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and is deadly to the ſowles. For ſomoch as that with more craffti and ſecret waies, he doth falſifie chriſtes doctrine, the holy goſpell, and the truth, It taketh Gods own word, geuing it fals vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and vſeth it for a weapon againſt Chriſt, and the truth. And this withowt feare of perſecution, perſuadeth vnder the shewe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and religion, that the falſedis, wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, and blaſphemies, be holy, and godly things. As for example that the pardons which to him that hath eies to ſee, be an open deceite, and yet he hath geuen to vnderſtand that thei forgeue ſinnes, with bullis, with viſitations of churches, with ſtacions, with pilgrimagis, with cordes, with girdles, with garmentis, and ſuch like trom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pery, and that thes things help to euerlaſting liffe. And here I might haue to talck a long time and coulde iff I wold, geue innumerable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but becaus I wold not be long, I haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geuen the example of the pardons. But to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to our purpos, among the whole nomber of doctrines, inuencions, deceites, craffti barte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Antichriſt, there is none ſo wittily done, with ſo great art and conueians, as the Maſſe. In the which Antichriſt him ſelff, hath beſtowed

all his witt, and all his knowlege in bilding it, to make it be cownted, and taken for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall worshipp of Chriſtian religion, nor one only hath not laid hand to this doing, but many.</p>
               <p>About the bilding off Salomons temple (the which ſurely was done with moſt high wiſdom) the bilders were <hi>7.</hi> yeares, and than thei ended the work.

And all this is done vnder color and shewe off doing a thing moſt choyſefull, and thankfull to God, for the benifite off the ſowles, and profite off the bodies. And Antichriſt hath not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howt gret caus beſtowed here all his whole knowlege and labor, becaus that he hath well ſeene, that principally his kingdom, and rule, conſiſteth in the ſame Maſſe as in a ſtrong ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell, and in a well defended hold.</p>

That he who goth to the Maſſe, or ſaith it, or ſtandeth there preſent at it, doith againſt Gods honor, it is to plaine, for that we haue in the former diſcours hetherto proued, that the Maſſe is the greateſt abhominacion that euer was in all worlds, becaus that there is committed a most gret Idolatry, and that honor that belongeth only to God, and Chriſt, is geuen to plaine creatures. The Maſſe is full of falſodes, of ſupersticions, of abuſes, of wickedneſsis, and of blaſphemies againſt God and Chriſt. And how can it be euer lawfull in any caſe (let it be what ſo euer it will) for a Chriſten man to ſay it to hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re it, or to be preſent at it? And iff a gentle man
<pb facs="tcp:12148:149"/>
do more eſteme his honor than his own liffe, how moch more ought we to eſteme Gods honor for the which we ought to gyue not only one, but infinite liues iff we had ſo many. And ſo moch the more as euery life is his gifft, and procedeth from him, yea is his?

               <p>I proue this thus. Paul ſaith to the Romains, euery thing that is not of faith is ſinn. Who is he knowing what maner a thing the Maſſe is, that knoweth not likewiſe the ſame to be againſt Gods word? Iff it be ſo, how than can one with faith, and good conſciens be preſent at a thing the which he iudgeth to be blaſphemos, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and againſt God? And who dowteth that he who doeth againſt his conſciens ſinnith, let him doo what ſo euer he will? It is not therfor lawful by any maner of meanes to be preſent at the Maſſe. That he doith againſt his neighbors ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetye likewiſe proue it. Firſt he offendeth, and

hurteth them that haue not yet the knowlege of Chriſt. For ſo moch as wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei ſee one that hath the knowlege of the goſpel, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at the Maſſe, her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken to it, bowe him ſelff, and knele to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worship it, what els can thei thinck, but that he hath the ſelf ſame opinion that thei them ſeluis haue? And this being perſuaded, thei be confirmed in their error, ſaing to them ſeluis, behold him who was come to that newe opinion or religion, now he changeth his mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to the old faith the which he had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Surely he wold neuer haue returned iff he had not knowen that he was deceiued by the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tens of the goſpell, and perceiued that with vs is the trewe goſpell, the trewe church and Chriſtes religion. God forbid that we shuld forſake our opinion, the which he with euident dedes, doth shewe to be good. And with thes thoughtes, thei be enſtranged from the goſpell, and from the truth, and be confirmed in error. Do yow thinck that this is a ſmall euell, with our example to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trange the mindes of men from the goſpell, and and from Chriſt, and to confirme them in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts church?</p>
               <p>Secondly it hurteth the weake faithfull, the which begin to bileue the goſpell, for whan thei

               <p>Thirdly he hurteth the ſtowt and ſtrong in faith, and hurteth the Christian cauſe it ſelff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus he maketh, that the wicked men more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie do ſay euell of the trew faith, doo wrong it, and make it hatefull, many maner of wayes. Is not this daily ſene, that how many moo men do ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly enter in to a lye, and in to an error, that ſo moch the more falſoode is ſtrengthned, and the ſame lye confirmed, and the trewth more downe beaten, And the wicked men becom ſo moch the more fearce, and ſtowt, to down beate the good caus, and all thos that defend it, as thei ſee it wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xe weaker?</p>
               <p>He doth alſo against his own ſowle helth. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he goth to the Maſſe againſt his conſciens,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12148:150"/>
he sheweth that he loueth better him ſelff, than Chriſt and God, and the tymed liffe, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the euerlaſting, and he is condemned by Chriſtes ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tens, the which ſaith, he that loueth his ſowle,<note place="margin">

So that than thes grownd workes remaining that the going to the Maſſe is againſt the honor of God, the profite of his neighbor, and againſt his own ſowle helth, that goth thether, It is an eaſy thing to anſwer to thos reaſons or rather ſcuſis that certen make of the which we haue ſpoken before.</p>
               <p>Where as firſt thei ſay that thei goo to the<note place="margin">1.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12148:151"/>
Maſſe, to auoide the offending of the ſimple and weake, and to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that thei shuld not thinck of them, that thei were deſpiſers, and mockers of religion, or els heretikes and enemyes off the church, iff thei goo not to the Maſſe. And that for ſuch reſpect it is good to diſſemble ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g till that ſuch weakelings might be brought to the trewe knowlege. I anſwer that there be <hi>2.</hi> ſortis of offences, the one is called an offence geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther an offence taken. The firſt offence is whan a man doth any euel work, by the which he offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth his neighbor. As for example, iff one shuld blaſp heme or committ ſome thefft, or els other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe shuld expreſsly doo against Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement. This maner of offence is an offence ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becaus that he who doth ſuch an euell work, doth ſurely giue occaſion of offence, the work being of it ſelff wicked, and against God. Or els iff the work off it ſelff were not wicked, but might be lefft vndone withowt offendinge God, and yet the man not hauing reſpect to his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke neighbor, wold doo it to ſatisfie, his appetite. As for example, there is one that hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the goſpell, and of Christ, and knoweth that a Christian may at all times with thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 4.</note> vſe euery meate for his neede, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shall chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12148:151"/>
ſomtime into the company of certen ſimple and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, the which shall thinck greuos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toffend iff thei shall eate fleſsh on the friday, and he that hath the knowlege, to ſatisfie his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite will eate of it, not hauing reſpect to thos poore ſowles the which be offended with him for that eating. This maner of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinneth, and doith againſt charitie as Paul ſaith to the Romains,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Roma.</hi> 14.</note> Iff for meate thy brother be trobled, thow doſt not now walk according to charitie. And in the <hi>1.</hi> to the Corinthes he ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corint.</hi> 8.</note> rather than the meate shuld offend my brother, I will neuer eate fleſsh. Thes ſuch like offences be called offencis geuen, becaus in dede the man giueth ſuch occaſion of offence and ſinneth.</p>
               <p>But there is a nother ſort of offencis, the which as I haue ſaid before are called offences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, shat is to ſay, whan a man is offended for things, for the which he ought not to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but taketh occaſion of offence withowt iuſt cauſe, as certen doo that be offended, at good workes, affter the maner of the Phariſeis, which were offended with Chriſt, becaus he healed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſick men on the Sabbath day, or els be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded iff a man abſtayne from wicked workes. Now this ſuch kind off offence is no ſinne,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:152"/>
becaus the man properly doth not geue offence, but other doo take it for offence the which thei ought not to doo, yea thei offend, esteming and cownting that to be offence, which is well done. The faithfull and godly man ought not to paſſe, euen as Chriſt paſſed not, though other were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for ſuch workes or things, for ſo moch as that a man muſt ceaſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well doing, or els muſt nedes doo euel, that wold auoyde ſuch kind off offencis. Euen ſo it is in this caſe. Iff any will be offended that one goth not to the Maſſe, or els that the Images be not honored, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not to care for it. For iff it had neded to care for ſuch offencis, it had bene fitt for the martirs that thei shuld haue worshipped the Idols, For the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters were offended at them, becaus thei wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipped them not. Yea, I ſay, that the ſimple and the weake, haue more occaſion off offence (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the trewe offence) and be more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, iff one that hath knowlege goo to the Maſſe, than iff he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not. For as before I haue proued, by ſuch going thei be hurt, for ſo moch as that thei be confirmed in their error, the which is moch wors for them to be ſo offended than to be offended, for that other offence the which, is no trew offence in dede.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:12148:152"/>To the ſaing of thapoſtle the which ſaith that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he did applie him ſelff to all men, and that we ought to doo the ſame, and to goo to the Maſſe with them that goo, I ſay, that thapoſtle Paul did applie himſelff to all men, in thos things that did not offend God, as was in certen ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and in his maner off liffe, and in certen cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which were no ſinne. He kept company with the Iewes, and liued as thei did, keping their ceremonies, forbearing thos meates that thei did forbeare. He did eate and drinck with the gentiles, he vſed their meates, he kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them, to haue occaſion to conuert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christ. And thes things were no ſinn, but in thos things wherein he shuld haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded God, he wold neuer haue applied him ſelff vnto them. And that this is trewe, Conſider that we reade not, that euer he did honor the Idols, or els went to ther ſacrifices. And why ſoo? Becaus he shuld haue offended God. So we knowing that the Maſſe is an abhominacion, we ought not by any maner of meanes to goo to it, but rather to dye than to goo thether, becaus it is againſt God, and Chriſtes honor, as we haue proued.</p>
               <p>To that other ſcuſe which ſaith, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the hartis, and conſidereth to what end
<pb facs="tcp:12148:153"/>
a thing is done, and ſo that a man doo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his hart to the abuſes that be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Maſſe, it is no ſinn to goo to it: I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, that if this reaſon auailed, the martyrs, as I haue ſayd before, might haue worshipped the Idols withowt ſinn, and we with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciens may denye Chriſt. For allthough that the martyrs shuld haue worshipped the Idols, thei wold neuer haue worshipped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the hart, but only owtwardly, and vnwillingly, And we may denye Chriſt with the mowth but not with the hart.

we shuld make plaine to men, our faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well with wordes, as with dedes. First for his own glory, becauſe that he is honored and glorified, whan the trewe religion is openly vtterid. Than further alſo, for the benifite of our neighbor, to thentent that by ſuch confeſsion, he might folow the trewe knowlege of God and ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly religion. And to proue this trewe, tell me aff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what ſort is the Chriſtian religion increaſed, except firſt by the preaching of the holy goſpell, and than by the blood of martyrs? The ydolaters ſaw the poore Chriſtians conſtant in acknowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Christes name, thei ſawe them perſecuted, taken, impriſoned, poniſshed, and miſerably mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred, and ſayd to them ſelues, ſurely this peple could neuer haue bene ſo conſtant, with ſo great and ſtowt mindes, nor thei wold neuer haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred ſo great tormentis, and ſo sharp death, iff thei had not bene certen that, affter this preſent life, there be laid vp for them, moſt great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: And iff this their religion had not bene trewe. And affter this ſort thei were conuertid to Chriſt, and Chriſtes religion increaſed, that is to ſay the nomber of byleuers.</p>
               <p>Further I ſay, that trewe faith is not withowt the profeſsion, not only of wordes, but of dedes
<pb facs="tcp:12148:154"/>
and workes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</note> Paul ſaith to the Hebrewes, that by faith the ſaintes haue wrought iustice, and ſome of them by faith were racked, tormented, and beaton, ſome were ſtoned, ſome cutt in pecis, ſawed, killed with the ſword, and diuers wayes exerciſed.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> And Iohn in the <hi>1.</hi> ſaith that our faith is the victory that ouercommith the world. He that hath the trewe faith, confeſſeth it, and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it with dedes. Therfor to be short I anſwer to that reaſon, and I ſay, that it is trewe, that God looketh vp on the hartis, and iff the hart had not conſentid, there shuld not haue bene any ſinne, but here in this caſe, the hart conſenteth vnto it, for iff the man had not agreid to goo to the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe, he wold not haue gone thether, but he goith becaus he agreith to goo although he goo the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnwillingly. The hart had not conſented, iff the man had bene caried thether by force, or dra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen thether with roopes, or chaynes, And in ſuch caſe he had not fawted. But this chanceth, not to thos that goo to the Maſſe, becaus thei be not forced to goo thether, but thei goo thether willingly, although with a certen lothſomnes. And we muſt knowe, that all that which is done vnwillingly, is not done by force, for ſo moch as many things be done with grefe, and vnwillin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12148:154"/>
and yet thei be done with the conſent of the mind. As for example, the taking of a bitter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, the cauſing of ſome ſick parte of the body to be cutt of, thes things shuld not be done iff the man were not content, and did not agree to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That ſaing, that is to ſay, that whan a man hath not a wicked, but a good intent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Roma.</hi> 3.</note> and doth that which he doth to help his neighbor, is not to the purpos, becaus we muſt not doo euell that good may come of it.</p>
               <p>To the other reaſon or rather ſcuſe, the which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ſaith that thei, that goo to the Maſſe, iff thei ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the knowlege of the goſpell, thei doo not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the abuſes, nor thos addicions that be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but only that which Chriſt made, that is to ſay, the Sacrament of his body and blood. For thos addicions doo not take away the ſubſtans of the Sacrament, I anſwer, firſt that that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as we haue ſaid before) is not Chriſtes tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we Sacrament, but although that it were a trewe Sacrament, it were not therfor conuenient to goo thether, ſeing there is in the ſame ſo many falſedes, ſo many errors and abuſes, which defile, and ſtaine, the clearnes of Chriſtes institucion. Nor it is not ynough to ſay, we doo allowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which Chriſt did, and not any
<pb facs="tcp:12148:155"/>
other: becaus that this allowing is only knowen to them ſelfes, and not to other, who whan thei ſee that one goeth to the Maſſe, doo thinck that, he allowith the whole, and thei be confirmed in their error iff thei be wicked, iff thei be not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, thei haue occaſion of offence and remayne offended. And although that none were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor confirmed in wickednes, yet vnderſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Maſſe is a bottom, and a rolle of blaſphemyes, how shuld the eares of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, behable to heare, and their eyes ſuffer to ſee, ſo great an abhominacion, the which ſo many wayes doth robb God and Chriſt, of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, yea that ſpeaketh euell of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To the examples alleaged of Ioſeph of the citie of Arimathea and of Nicodemus, Iuſt and holy men, the which for feare of the Iewes did diſſemble, I anſwer firſt that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferens betwene thes <hi>2.</hi> and thos that goo to the Maſſe. For although for feare thei did not open them ſelues to be Chriſtes diſciples, neuertheles thei did not for all that committ any maner of Idolatry, nor thei we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to ſuch abhominacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as the Maſſe is. Further, it is no good reaſon, to goo abowt to defend a mans own fawtes, with the fawtes of holy men. Nor we ought not to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12148:155"/>
the ſaintes in thos things wherein thei haue erred, but only in thos things that be worthy of commendacion. What a foliſsh thing were it, iff an adulterer wold make his excuſe that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt adultery is not euell, becaus that Dauid committed adultery. And wold excuſe the deniall of Chriſt to be no ſinn, becaus that Peter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him thriſe? Euen ſo doo thei that will with Ioſephs and Nicodemuſsis weakenes ſcuſe their error, that is to ſay, that it is lawfull to goo to the Maſſe, and diſſemble, becaus that thos <hi>2.</hi> holy men, for feare haue diſſembled, thei being of Chriſtes diſciples. But let thes maner of men tell me this one point, what is the caus why thei doo not rather follow thes holy men in the ſtowtnes of their doings, rather than in their weaknes, that is to ſay that although whilſt Chriſt liued on the earth thei were affraid to be knowen for his diſciples, neuertheles at the time of his death whan all the other diſciples were hid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don, except Iohn, and the wemen, and whan, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in any other time thei shuld haue bene affrayed, than thei waxed stowt.</p>
               <p>Thus thei in time of tribulacion, and whan there was cauſe of feare be came ſtowt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d did not remaine fearfull. Why doo thei not folow them
<pb facs="tcp:12148:156"/>
in the ſtowtnes of the mind, which is a vertew, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not in the weaknes of feare which is a vice? Who dowteth that Ioſeph, and Nicodemus, whan thei diſſembled for feare, were weake and vnperfite Chriſtians, and erred in that thei did not boldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe Chriſt? Let vs not I pray yow alleage the holy men in things euel done, to folowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in things worthy of prayſe and well done, only, for ſo moch as that in thos things only we ought to folowe them, and not in other.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> To the example of Naaman Syrus, I ſay, that thei alleage it herein euell, ſayng, that Heliſeus shuld licens him that he might enter in to the Gods temple of the Aſſyrians, called Remmon, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with the king of Aſſyria, and to wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip with him, and I ſay, that this is not trewe, yea it is cleane contrary, as it appeareth in the ſtory of the ſame Naaman writton in the fourth booke of the kings,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 5.</note> where the text ſayth, that the ſame Naama<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chefe of the king of Aſſyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s warr, whan he was healed of the leproſy by Heliſeus, thorow Gods might, and being waſshed <hi>7.</hi> times in the riuer of Iordan, whan he was returned to Helyſeus, he ſayd, Surely I knowe that there is no nother God on the whole earth, but he of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and deſyring to gyue him a gifft, Helyſeus

            <p>Now to return to the purpoſe of the ſtrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, that is of the ſacraments, Some ſay that in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the body and blood of Chriſt, that is to ſay, in the breade and wyne conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in remembrans of his death, is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his very body and his very blood, and that there we haue really, and bodily, all and hole Chriſt, as great, and as thick as he was on the croſſe. Other ſome ſay that he is not the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but there is only the breade and the wine as ſignes of Chriſtes body, and blood, geuen for our redempcion. And this controuerſy and ſtriffe is in ſuch ſort gone forward, that it hath with many hindered the courſe of the holy goſpel. And it hath made that Chriſtes enemies haue taken occaſion, and boldnes to blaſpheme, the holy lerning and gods truth. But be it as it will, allthough ſome haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted a great fawt in this thing, ſtriuing euer bitterly againſt the contrary opinion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thei haue shewed them ſelues to be men, and haue in ſom part ſpotted their own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, leſſening the credite and auctoritie that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:12148:165"/>
the world had of them: We not withſtanding, will comfort our ſeluis with Paules ſaing, which he ſpeaketh to the roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that preſently thorow ſuch diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyon, we ſee among many nothing but diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, offence, and euel, yea hatred toward the goſpell, yet god for all that, who knoweth how to get order owt of diſorder, and good owt of euell, will caus whan it shall pleaſe him, ſome great profite to growe owt of it in his church, for the preſent vnknowen, but in the end open, thus we ſchuld beleue.</p>
            <p>And becaus I know that many deſire to vnderſtand what shuld be the trewe opinion of this ſacrament.

            <p>And in this opinyon there be alſo ij. diuers myndes.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12148:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
myracle, becaus god can doo all things. And this is the opinion of the pryſtes and fryres of the romish church. And they haue in ſuch ſort preached it, that the worlde in tyme paſt from certen hondreth yeares hetherto, haue bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cownted it, as an article of the faith. And woo to hym that had ſayd the contrary. For they wold haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d burnt him, as an heretik. And that, becauſe the pope, who was taken for god on earth, for Chriſtes lefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and had auctoritie to make men beleue what ſo euer liked hym, and euery man was brought to his determinacion, wold nedes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it ſo.</p>
            <p>Certen other of the firſt opinion too, the which holdeth that Chriſt is realli, and bodily in the Sacrament, doo ſaie, that not witſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Chriſtes body is, wholly in the brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, and his blood wholli in the wine, yet the breade and the wine abide in their ſubſtance as before, and be not turned nor changed in to a nother thing, as the former opinion ſaith. And thes maner of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt nedes ſaie, that at the leaſt .iij. very great miracles, muſt come to paſſe in this Sacrament. The
<pb facs="tcp:12148:169"/>
firſt is, that Chriſt is, wholli under that brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d under that wine, as great, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as thick, as he was on the croſſe, and as preſentli as he is in heauen. This is a gret thing, that a great body continewyng great, ſhuld be incloſed in a litle thing, moch leſſe then the ſame bodi.</p>
            <p>The ſecond miracle is, that Christes whole bodi and his wholle blood is in the whole bread, and in the whole wine, and in eueri, yea the leaſt part of thone, and the other, as it is ſaid of our reaſonable ſowle, that it is whole in the whole bodi, and whole in euery part of the body, in ſuch ſort as if there ſhuld be made x. thowſand partes of the breade, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wine, whole Chriſt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his whole blood, ſhuld be in eueri of thos diuided partes, which is yea a greater thing, withowt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of the being of the ſowle in the whole bodi, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in eueri part of the bodi. For allthough the ſowle be in eueri part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>di, whileſt that the partes abide yoined toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, yet it is not in all the partes of the bodi, whan thei be ſeparated. For whan one part is diuided from the body, the ſowle is no more in the ſame. But Chriſtes bodi and blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12148:169"/>
to this opinion, be in all the partis of the bread a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the wine, whan thei be yoined to gether, and whan thei be diuided, or ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. The third miracle is, that the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the ſame blood, is in heauen and in earth both at a time, and is in all places of the world, where the ſacrament is, In France, in Spayne, in England, in Almainy, in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in Italy, in the eaſt, in the weſt, in this, in that citie, In this in that church, on this,<note place="margin">The taberna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle is a litle-cloſet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is kept nere the altare.</note> on that Altare, In this, in that tabernale, as thei ſay. Yea and that thei ſay, that Chriſt is euery where, and filleth euery thing. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for them that put, or will haue the changing of the ſubſtances, of the bread and the wine, that is to ſay, that their tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion, to put beſides thes .iij. miracles, others alſo, and to make a better marcket of miracles, than thei that put it not, yea a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter market, than the holy ſcripture and god maketh, to whom notwithſtonding belongeth to make miracles, who is not ſo liberall of mirakels as thei be.</p>
            <p>The chefe grownd worck of this firſt opinion is, that Chriſt ſaid. This is my bodi,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:170"/>
shewing the breade, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d This is my blood, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the wine. And therfor Chriſt muſt be in the ſame ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For els he shuld haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſely, the which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be. Thei bring furth in dede other reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but thei all doo litle auai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le, as that ſame, that if Chriſt were not in the ſacrament, it ſhuld not haue bene ſo gret a fawt, to him that had receiued it vnworthely, as Paul ſaith, that is to ſay, who euer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that breade, and drinketh that wine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyle, he eateth and drinketh Iudgement, that is to ſay, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation. If Chriſt were not there (ſay they) it ſhuld not be condemnation to eate that breade, and to drink that wine, But the condemnacion is to him that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and drinketh vnworthily, Therfor Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſtes very body, and blood, is there. And the ſame Paul, in the ſelf ſame chapter, doth call the conſecrated bread, the lords body, and therfor they ſay, that Chriſt is in that breade, and in that wine. Thei of this opinion, to my Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doo make no other reaſons, that be any thing worth. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whan we ſhall haue placed the trewe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12148:170"/>
opinion, we will anſwer to this ſhewſom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon, and with the help of the lord, we will make it appeare, that it is triffling, and of no valewe.</p>
            <p>The other opinion, and mind abowt this matter is, that Chriſtes body, and blood, be really in heauen, where he ſitteth on the right hand of god the father, and that thei be not really, and bodily in the ſacrament, but ſaith that the bread, and the wine, be ſignes appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted, to ſignifie the body and the blood, how Chriſt Ieſus hath geuen both thone, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for our ranſom, and ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, to thentent that we ſhuld kepe in our rememberans, ſo great a thing and miſtery, as he him ſelf whan he did inſtitute the ſame ſacrament in the preſence of thapoſtles, ſayd,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Marc.</hi> 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> that is to ſay, as oft as yow ſhall doo this, yow ſhall doo it in my remembera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And this is the trew and catholik opinion, a greable with the holy ſcripture, and with the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the old church, and awncient teachers, the which haue not ſaid, as any one of the for ſaid opinions ſaith, that is to ſay, that Chriſtes body and blood, be incloſed in that
<pb facs="tcp:12148:171"/>
breade, and wine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moch leſſe as thother opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſayth, the which affirmeth, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the breade, and wine, be turned in to Chriſtes body, and blood, and that there is no more neyther breade, nor wine, but only the withcommes, of thone and thother, but ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue ſayd, that the breade and the wine remaine a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be ſignes, of the body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the bloode, for to bring to our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brans, the moſt great a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d high benefite that Chriſt hath wrought vs, dieng for vs, that is to ſay, of our redempcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the growndworkes of this opinion be ſure. and of ſuch ſort ſtedfaſt, that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in the world, be not ſufficient to throwe them to the grownd, becauſe thei be grownd wrought, vp on the ſure rock, that is to ſay, thei agree with gods trowth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his word that abideth for euer. We doo not Intend now he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to bring furth all the reaſons, and grownd workes, with the which this opinion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For we ſhuld than make a long treatyſe, and not a ſermon, to informe the ignorante and Io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glings in the knowlege of gods things, as we intend to doo. But we will only bring furth ſome fewe perſuaſions, by the which it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12148:171"/>
may be clerely knowen, that it is euen ſoo as we ſayd.</p>
            <p>Firſt this opinion ſaith,<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> that the definicion of the ſacrament, muſt nedes shewe, and make Plaine to vs, that the matter ſtandeth thus, that is to ſay, that the breade, and the wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, and that Chriſtes body, and blood, is not really there in them. For the definicion of a ſacrament receiued of all men (and is ſent Auguſtines a catholike doctor) is this, that is to ſay, that a ſacrament is a ſigne of a holy" thing. Euery man confeſſeth that the than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes geuing is a ſacrament. If it be a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is no nother but a ſigne of an holy thing. If it be a ſigne of an holy thing, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not that the breade and the wine, for to be ſignes, shuld be changed in to other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for ſo moch as that the ſignes, that thei may be ſignes, do not change any ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtans, but only take a newe ſignificacion. And it is moch leſſe nedefull, that Chriſtes body, and blood shuld be really, and bodily preſent in the ſame breade and wine, for ſo moch as it is not neceſſary that the things ſignified, and repreſented by the ſignes, shuld be incloſed, or
<pb facs="tcp:12148:172"/>
preſent in the ſame ſignes, as by experiens we may ſee in many ſortes of ſignes, that it is not nedefull that the thing ſignified, shuld be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent, or incloſed in the ſigne. It is ynough that it be repreſented. Let vs geue an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. The Emperours Image is a ſigne of the Emperor, And becauſe it is no nother but a ſigne, we will neuer ſay that the Emperor him ſelf, is in that Image, nor that that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, is changed in to the emperors parſon. For if he were preſent where his Image is, he neded not to ſett vp the ymage, for ſo moch as the Image is therfor ſett vp (ſpeaking of the bodied things) in any place, becauſe the thing ſignified, is not there preſent, and therfor it is ſett vp to thentent, that it may repreſent it. So will we ſay of the breade, and of the wyne, that Chriſt hath Inſtituted them to thentent, that thei might be repreſenters of his body and blood, to thentent, that whan we ſee them, and vſe them for a ſacrament, as he hath ordeined, we shuld remember that Chriſt hath geuen them, that is to ſay, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood, for our ranſoming. And for to be ſignes affter this ſort, it nedeth not that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12148:172"/>
the body and blood shuld be there bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and moch leſſe that thei shuld be changed in to other ſubſtances. It ſuffiſeth, as we haue ſaid, that thei be ſignes as we haue ſpoken of the ſignes of the emperours yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</p>
            <p>The reaſon ſtandeth in this, that the tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks geuing, or for to vſe paules wordes, the lordes ſupper is no nother but a ſacrament, therfor it is no nother but a ſigne. Becauſe by the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allredy geuen, <hi>A</hi> ſacrament is a ſigne of an holy thing. The ſigne of a thing is not the thing it ſelf, nor is not changed in to it, but only doth ſignifie it, Therfor the breade and the wyne be not changed in to Chriſtes body and blood nor they be not incloſed in them, that is to ſay in the bread and the wyne, And it ſuffiſeth that thei be truly repreſented by the bread and the wyne. And though we ſay that the bread ea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wyne, be no nother but ſignes, we meane not to denye the effects, that the ſpyrite of god (of the which the ſame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be the myniſtery) doth worke in the beleuers that receiue them. For by meanes of the ſacraments, the trewe beleuers be as it

were, by certen ſignes and ſeales of god con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his promiſes and be aſſuered of gods grace, and of many benyfites, which god doth geue vs, through Chriſt, but we doo only de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye that Christ, is body lythere, for ſo moch as that to work thes effectis, which we ſay, that the ſacraments by the verteu of the holy goſt doo work, it ſuffiſeth that they be ſignes appoynted by god to that end. And it nedeth not that Chriſt shuld be there bodyly preſent nor that there shuld be made any change of the ſuſtances, of the breade and the wyne.</p>

               </note>Further, this ſacrament was inſtituted by Chriſt in remembrans as the wordes them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the ſame inſttucion, doo witnes, ſaing, Doo this in mi rememberans. If it be ſo than that it was inſtituted for remembrans, it is not neceſſary that Christ should be bodyly there, and moch leſſe that there should be made any turnyng of the bread and the wyne, in to his body and blood, becauſe that the bread and the wyne, doo ſuffiſe to bring to remembrans, his paſsion and his body and blood geuen for our ranſom, As the paſchal lamb was ſufficient to bring to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berans the paſſe ouer, that is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12148:173"/>
to ſay, the paſsing by of the Angel in Egypt. Yea it is not only not neceſſary that he shuld be there, but if he were there he shuld be the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in vayne, becaus he shuld be there in ſuch ſort as shuld help nothing to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berans, for ſo moch as that he could not be ſeene. And it is behouefull that the ſignes that bring a thing to rememberans, as the ſacramentes doo shuld be ſeeable. And it is well knowen to what end the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were inſtituted, that is to ſay, becauſe we be bodyed, as the old doctors ſay, and among the reſt, Chryſoſtom vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mathew, the. <hi>83.</hi> 
               <q>Omelye, the which ſayth that therfor they were inſtituted, that by them, as by certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeable ſignes, our mynd shuld be ſtyrred vp to the ſpyrituall, and vnſeeable things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the ſame ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes.</q> And therfor ſaint Auguſtne calleth the ſacraments, ſeeable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſo that if we were vnbodied, it neded not to inſtitute them. The reaſon ſtandeth in this. The ſacraments were inſtituted in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brans of Chriſtes body and blood geuen for vs. That which ſeruith for remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as an owtward ſigne, ought to be ſeeable. Chriſtes body and blood if thei were in the ſacrament, shuld be
<pb facs="tcp:12148:174"/>
vnſeeable, therfor thei shuld nothing ſerue to put vs in remembrance. If thei shuld no waie ſerue to put vs in remembrance, than it is not neceſſary nor conuenient, that thei shuld be bodily preſent in the ſacrament, And it is enough that the ſeeable ſignes, shuld be there, that is to ſay, the bread and the wine, which may work that is to ſay, which may bring to remembrances the body and blood, the which thing Chriſtes bodily preſens in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t could not doo.</p>
            <p>I confirme this reaſon thus, If Chriſt be there bodily preſent in the ſacrament of thanksgeuing, and the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and the wine be changed in to his body, and blood, we muſt ſay, that either this is by a comen, and generall right of a ſacrament, the which ſhuld belong not only to this but alſo to all the other ſacraments, orels by a par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticular and ſpeciall right, of this ſacrament only. That is to ſay, that this and not the reſt, shuld haue this prerogatiue. Of neceſsitie it muſt be by one of thes ij. rightes, or els by them both. But firſt we can not ſay that it is by a comon, and generall right of a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12148:174"/>
that is to ſay, that if a thing be a ſacrament, it ſhuld be neceſſary, that the thing ſignified by the ſame ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shuld there be preſent, and moch leſſe that ther ſhuld be made any tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of the ſubſtances, this can not be ſayd, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe that their things ſignified ought tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be there preſent in all the other ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that there ſhuld be made a changing of the ſubstances.

The flesh of the paſchal lamb remained flesh, as before, And we will ſai the ſame of the rock, and of the manna, that there was no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner change of ſubſtancc.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:12148:175"/>The newe ſacramentes alſo of the Chriſtian people, thei alſo doo not change ſubſtance.

The other likewiſe which be by the ſcoole men, and newe doctors cownted for ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is to ſay, Creame, Oile, which thei call holy, Penans, Orders and matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the which in deede be no ſacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus thei were not inſtituted by Chriſt for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, thei doo not change their ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but remaine in their firſt ſubſtance, and there is made no maner of change, This is cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſo that there nedeth not by comon and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral right of ſacraments, to put Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died preſens in the ſacrament, and moch leſſe to affirme that there shuld be made, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciall changing of the bread, and the wine, in to his body and blood. Nor we ought not neither to ſay, that by particular, and ſpeciall right of this ſacrament, Chriſt shuld be bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, nor that there shuld be made ſuch maner of change, For ſo moch as that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular right of this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, cheeflie that it shuld be a ſigne, ſondred from the other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that is to ſay, that it shuld be bread,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12148:175"/>
and wine in ſubſtance, which be things diuers from the other ſacraments. And further, that it shuld haue a particular, and diuers ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacion, from the other, that is to ſay, that it is inſtituted to bring particularly to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberans, Chriſtes paſsion, and death, and that it shuld repreſent vnto vs, how Chriſt gaue his body, and shed his blood, for our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming. This is the particular and ſpeciall right of this ſacrament, by the which it is ſondri and diuers from the other ſacraments. But it is not neceſſary by this ryght, that there shuld be made a change of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the breade and wine, and that Chriſt shuld be in the ſacrament. For the breade and wine remayne in their ſubſtances as thei we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re firſt, and may (withowt that that Chriſt shuld be preſent in the ſacrament) work thes effects, that is to ſay, bring to our remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, and repreſent vnto vs, Chriſtes paſsion, and death, and how he hath geuen his body, and blood, for our ranſoming. It is ynough for the working of this rememberans, that thei haue a newe ſignificacion. It is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to change the ſubſtances, as in the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:12148:176"/>
reaſon we haue ſayd. Yea, I ſay, that ſeing the ſacraments were inſtituted to thentent that thei shuld be trewe ſignes, of holy things, their ſubſtance muſt nedes remayne, as it was firſt. For otherwiſe, thei shuld not haue agrement and likelied, with ther things ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor thei shuld not be trewe ſignes. As for example, baptiſme hath lykelihode with the ſpiritual waſshing, becauſe it is water. And as the water waſsheth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeth the body, ſo be thos that beleue in Chriſt ſpiritually cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d waſshed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſinnes, but if the Water of ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptiſme shuld not remaine, water, but shuld cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge the ſubſtance, it shuld not haue ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Soo we will ſay of the breade, and the wine, that therfor thei haue likelied with Chriſtes body, and blood, becauſe thei abide ſtill breade a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine, for ſo moch as, that euen as the breade, and the wine, doo noryſsh, and mainteine the life of the body, ſo Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and blood receiued ſpiritually, and thorow faith in to the mind, doo noriſsh and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vs, in the ſpirituall life. And for this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Chriſt Ieſus called his fleſsh verily meate, and his blood verily drinck. But if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12148:176"/>
of breade, and wine shuld not abide but the only withcommes shuld remaine, there shuld not be that liklihode, and agreement which this ſacrament requireth, becauſe that the only withcommes of breade, and wine wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thowt the ſubſtances, can not noriſsh. And whan the dewe agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d likelyhode is not there, thei shuld not be trewe ſignes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, thei shuld not be trewe ſacraments. And here it may be ſeene, that thei of this opinion, deſtroie the ſacraments, making them not to be trewe but vaine ſignes taking from them the growndwork of their trewe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> nother reaſon is this.<note place="margin">The third reaſon.</note> If Chriſt were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie in the ſacrament it should be nothinge profitable, forſomuch as, that the onelie ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eatinge of Chriſt, is that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohan.</hi> 6.</note> that is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as the ſame Chriſt himſelf ſaid to them that thought, whan he ſaid, that his bodie was meat, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his bloude drinke, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull for the hauinge of life, to eat his flesh and to drinke, his blode, They thought (I ſay) that he ment to ſpeake of the bodily eatinge, and drinkinge, ſending the one and the other,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:177"/>
thorow the mouthe in to the ſtomake, as alſo, they beleue, that hold, that Chriſt should be perſonalli, and bodely in the ſacrament. What ſaid Chriſt to theſe maner of men? The ſpirit is that whiche geueth life, the flesh helpeth nothinge, that is to ſaye, when I ſaie, that you muſt eate my fleshe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k my bluode, I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that you muſt eat my flesh, and drink my bluode ſpiritually, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after this ſorte, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue lyfe but my flesh eaten, and my blood dron<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, as you vnderſtand it, do help nothinge. It is neceſſary for the geuing of lyfe that my flesh be eaten, and my blood be dronken ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and not fleshly. Chriſt is eaten and his blood is dronken ſpiritually as he him ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleue in him: And Auguſtine i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the expoſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaid words ſaith <hi>Crede et ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducaſti,</hi> that is to ſai beleue and thou hast eaten, geuinge to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that Chriſts intent was, when he ſaid theſe words, that is to ſai, that it was behoufull to eat his flesh and drink his blood, to ſay that it was beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uefull to beleue in him, And after this ſorte, his body was eaten, and his blode was dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. And the text it ſelf geueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12148:177"/>
that this is trewe, the which ſaith firſt, that the fathers will is, that euery one that beleueth in Chriſt should haue lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lafting. <q>And a fewe words, he addeth, veryly, veryly I ſay vnto you, he that beleueth in me, hath lyfe euerlaftinge. I am the bread of lyfe And a litle after, he ſaith, if you shall not eat the flesh of the ſonne of man and drink his blood, you shall not haue lyfe in you.</q> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath lyfe euerlaſtinge. If thes wordes ſpoken by Chriſt, be trew as neceſſaryly thei must be trew, becauſe Chriſt cannot tell an vntroth. It doth neceſſaryly folow that the eatinge his flesh and drinking his bloode, is none other, but to beleue in him or at the least, that the eatinge his flesh and drinking his blood, and the beleuing in him, be things ſo ioyned to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they cannot be ſeparate the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. The reaſon is this becauce that if theſe words were not the ſame in ſentence, or ells that thei were ſuche as might be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the one from the other, that is to ſay, that the one might be trew without the other, we muſt needs ſay, that a man might be ſaued,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:178"/>
and haue the lyfe euerlaſting, without the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Chriſts flesh, and drinking his blood, the which is againſt Christs expreſſe wordes, who ſaieth that he can not haue lyfe that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not his flesh and drinketh not his blood. Or els we muſt nedes ſaye, that a man might be ſaued not beleuinge in Chriſt. This is clere becauſe Chriſt ſaith that he that eateth his flesh, and drinketh his blood, hath lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. If it be ſo that man is ſaued by eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, when as this eating, and drinkinge, be not the ſame that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuinge is, or els that they may be ſeparated, that is to ſai that the eating, and drinkinge, should be without the beleuing, a man then shall haue life euerlaſtinge without beleuing in Chriſt, the which likewiſe is againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſts expreſſe words, who will that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleueth should be ſaued a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he that beleueth not should be damned. Seing then that the one a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the other of theſe two ſainges be trew, that is to ſaie, that he that eateth Chriſts fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d drinketh his blood hath lyfe euerlaſting and he that dothe not this can not haue it.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12148:178"/>
And this other alſo is trewe, that is to ſaie he that beleueth in Chriſt, hath lyfe euerlastinge and he that doth not beleue cannot haue it: It followeth, of neceſsitie, that to eate Chriſts flesh and to drink his blood, and to beleue in him should be one ſelf thinge or els yf they should not be the ſame, at the leaſt that they could not by any meanes be ſeparated, that is to ſaie, the one to be without the other. I haue made this longe diſcourſe to make men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that theſe words of Chriſt of the eating of his flesh and drinking his blood, be not to be vnderſtand of the bodyly eatinge, and drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king, and much leſſe are to be vnderſtand of the eating and drinking the ſacrament of the lords ſupper, but of the onely ſpirituall eatin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and drinkinge, and thei that alledge them of the body or els of the ſacramentall eating or drinking, do alledge them out of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Further alſo to make men know the chefe purpoſe, that is to ſai, that althoughe Chriſt were bodely in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it should helpe nothing, becauſe that the fleſhly eating after what ſo euerſorte it should be done, doth
<pb facs="tcp:12148:179"/>
nothing proffit to the witneſſing of Chriſt, ſeing the ſpiritual eatinge onely, is that which geueth life.</p>
            <p>And if any wold anſwer and ſaie that when Chriſt ſaid that the fleſh did help nothinge, that he did meane, that it did help nothing, whan it was eaten, as they did vnderſtand it, to whome Chriſt ſpake, that is to ſaie, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaits, the which thought that he did mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to ſaie, that they should eat his fleſh as the fleſh of the shambells is eaten, and drink his blood as wine and water is dronk. But Chriſt in the ſacrament, is eaten after ſuche a certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſort as he is not ſeane nor perceauid, no nor chewed, becauſe he is in the ſame ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vndiuideably, nor his fleſh is not eaten nor blood dronken for to noriſh the body, as other bodelie meates, but to noriſhe the ſoule. And therfore Chriſt reprouid the Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties becauſe thei vnderſtode him euel fauored<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not as he wold be vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>This anſwer is nothinge, for whan Chriſt ſaid, that the fleſh helpeth nothinge, but the ſpirite is that which geueth life, he ment that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:12148:179"/>
the only ſpirituall eating the which is done with the harte and with the minde thorow belefe was that which helped, but the bodily and fleſhly eating, helped nothing after what ſo euer ſort it should be done. There is no doubt, but though that Chriſt be not eaten in peeces and partes, orels chawed as other fleſh is chawed and eaten, as the Capernaites did vnderſtand it: Yet not with ſtandinge, after what ſo eauer ſort he should be eaten, by the bodily mouth, whether it were by parts or whole as they of the firſt opinion beleue, the which will, that Chriſt great and thick as he was vpon the wood of the croſſe, ſhuld be who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in the ſacrament, that is to ſay, in that litle hoſt, as they call it. This is a fleſhly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bodely eating, for ſo much, as that a thing is no whit leſſe bodely eaten, whan it is put all hole into the mouth, and ſent into the ſtomake, as Ionas was wholy ſwalowed by the whale, or as the pills that be receauid whole. It is no whitleſſe bodely eaten (I ſay) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it were eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. I therfor by the bodily eati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g do meane that which is not of the ſpirite. This of the whiche they ſpeak, that is done by the mouthe, is not
<pb facs="tcp:12148:180"/>
with the minde therfor it is bodely, If it be bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie, it helpeth nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. I wil ſay to be ſhorte, that if Chriſt were bodily preaſent in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that his being there should be nothinge ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable at all, althoughe that we should eat his fleſh, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k his bluode a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d times, for ſo much as that the ſpiritual eating, and drinkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge onely the which is by faith, beleuinge true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in him, is that, whiche helpeth. The bodely and fleſhly eating and drinking his body and blood, the which is done by the mouth helpeth nothing. They then do litle honour to Chriſt, that wold that he should be really, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe they wold bringe to paſſe, that Chriſt should haue made vnprofitable thinges, the whiche we may not think, much leſſe ſpeake.</p>
            <p>But becauſe we haue ſaid, that the onely ſpirituall eating and drinking Chriſts flesh and bluode, is that which helpeth, and not the bodely, ſome man might ſaye to what purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe then did Christ inſtitute the ſacramentall eatinge and drinkinge, the which is not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but bodelye &amp;c. To this I anſwer, that the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was therfore i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtituted by Chriſt becauſe that although the eatinge and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:12148:180"/>
of it, be not ſpirituall but bodely, yet not with ſtanding it ſerueth, and is profitable, to the ſpirituall eating and drinking, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is by faith for ſo much as the ſacrament doth confirme vs in faith, becauſe it is ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this end. Not that it shuld already ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue this power of it ſelf, but becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, or els a miniſterie of the ſpirite, ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the word of the holye goſpell, with which inſtrument, and ministerie, the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite worketh in vs, And it is not neceſſarye that Chriſt should be bodelye in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſerue for the eating and drinkinge ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and by faith, it is enoughe that the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad and the wyne, as holye ſignes, be there for vs, as we will better tell you in the laſt reaſon. And whan I ſay that the ſpirituall eating, and drinkinge onelye, is proffitable, and not the bodelie, I meane of the bodely eating, of the ſame trew bodye, and of the bodely drinking, of the trew bloude of Chriſt put into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uth as the Capernaites did meane, and as they affirme, the which wold haue Chriſt to be really in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, both in bodye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſoule. I do not meane of the ſacramentall eating the
<pb facs="tcp:12148:181"/>
which without doubt is profitable, when it is ioyned with the ſpirituall. And whan it is not ioyned, it is not onely not profitable, but it is damnable, as Saint Paule ſaieth in the firſt to the Corinthians becauſe it is vnworthelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 11.</note> If Chriſt then, be not really in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the ſubſtances of the bread and the wine, be much leſſe chaunged, but do both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in ſubſtance as be fore.</p>

               <note place="margin">The fourth reaſon.</note>Another reaſon is this, and it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie againſt the opinion of transſubstancia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to ſaye of them that would that the bread and the wine shuld be chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſu Chriſtes bodye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blode, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that there shuld remaine no more of the bread and the wine, but the withcommes, that is to ſaye, the white coloure of the bread, the coloure of the wine, the taſte of the one and the other, the roundnes or other forme of the ſame bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, And ſo we will ſaie of the other withcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that is to ſaie of the moyſtines, drines, heat and could.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12148:181"/>
wherfore if there were one that should eat, a quantitie of hoſtes and wine conſecrated, they wold noriſhe as other bread and wine not conſecrated.

of ſuch chaunges. Like as we haue ſaid of the noriſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we wil ſay of the inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deringe, the which we may ſee is made in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wormes be enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered. How ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſubstance be engendered, of the only withcommes?</p>
            <p>Here thy of this opinion be intangled and they anſwer ſome after one ſorte, and ſome after another. Innocentius the thirde, in his booke of the office of the maſſe ſaith that euen as the ſubſtance of the bread is miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly turned into the ſubſtance of Chriſts body the withcommes only of the bread and the wine remaininge, ſo the ſubſtance of the bread, of the which the wormes or any other thinge, might be enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered, may miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie returne. Egidius Romanus in his Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of Chriſts bodie ſaith, that ſuch an enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge is nat miraculous, but natural, for becauſe (ſaith he) that the reaſonable mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, althoughe it be made by god onelie, yet not with ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, for as muche as god hath diſpoſed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ordened, that after the bodie of the creature be faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, the reaſonable ſoule is put into the ſame creatures bodie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this is a natural poinct by the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods order ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d if it were otherwiſe it shuld be a
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12148:182"/>
gainſt the order of nature. Euen ſo ſeinge that god hath ordeined, that the withco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes shuld be grownded in the ſubſtance as ſoone as the withcommes of the bread and the wine, be corrupted immediatly, by the natural order that he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to things doth creat the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d doth put it vnder thother withcommes newlie brought in of the which matter the wormes be after engendered. Some other ſay that a noriſhinge matter may be enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered in the prieſts ſtomake, the whiche with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t receaued may eaſely noriſhe, although the formes, that is to ſay the withcommes of the bread and the wine of them ſelfes should not norishe. Certein other haue ſaid, that euen as god by miracle hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that the withcomes of bread and wine, should be without ſubiect, as though they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſubſtances, ſo he geueth them the nature of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the bread and wine, that is to ſay, that the wormes may be enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered of the withcommes and ſo we muſt ſay that by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, ſubſtances may be engendered of things whiche be no ſubſtances, although ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter be impoſible by nature. But what dreames? what imaginacions? (and let them
<pb facs="tcp:12148:183"/>
pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me) what mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters be theſe? who maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuer that it is ſo? as for example, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce gathereth Innocentius that the ſubſtance of the bread should miraculouſly returne? And Egidius Romanus that god should creat new matter, and should, put it vnder the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes newly brought in, and vnder the shape of a thinge newly enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred? And thoſe other, that a noriſhinge matter should be engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſtomake? And finally the laſt of all, that by gods might, a ſubſtance should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered of the withcommes? If in a matter of our faith, we wil after this ſorte dallie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe at a ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture without the holy ſcripture, we may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n ſettforth and affirme al that we liſt, as thoughe it were trew, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tel as many pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and fables, I will not ſay follies as shall come in oure head. We ought not to dreſſe vp gods things after oure maner, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as toies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in our braine: but we muſt handle them with fear and reuerence a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with gods words, and walk ſuerly not accordinge to oure owne pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies. Without doubt, this Imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the chaunginge of the ſubſtance of the bread, and wine into Chriſts bodie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blode, and that the onely withcomes of the bread, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:12148:183"/>
remaine, is falſe. but the ſubſtances of the bread and wine remaine, for if they should not remaine theſe euident and open effectes could not be wrought, that is to ſaie, the noriſhinge a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d new e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deringe which be made. The cauſe whie they ſpeak thus, that is to ſay, without ani maner of groundeworke, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be forced to graunt to mani inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, is, becauſe they defend an euell, and an vniuſt cauſe, and therfo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re they muſt graunte many inconueniences. And in dede (as it is commenly ſaid) they wote not what they fiſhe for, beare with me you readers, ſeing I tell the trueth.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is this.<note place="margin">The fift reaſon.</note> God is not wont to work miracles but for to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the faith of the beleuers, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his doctrine, as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſainct mark in the end of his goſpell.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marci</hi> 16.</note> And the miracles that Chriſt worketh for to confirme his word and the faith of the beleuers, be ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albe thinges, as it is manifeſt, lokinge tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the miracles, that Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtels wrought, as geuing ſight to the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, clenſinge the leepers, makinge the domme to ſpeak, the lame to go, healing the feuered, and the other ſick, reiſing the dead, walking
<pb facs="tcp:12148:184"/>
on the water of the ſea, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge the wi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, chaunging the water into wine, driuing awaie the deuels, ſatisfyng with a few loaues, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine fiſhes many thouſand perſons. All theſe miracles were ſeen, and therfore did confirme the doctrine of the holy goſpell: but if they had bene ſecret that none had ſeene them, they had helped nothing to that matter, that is to ſaie, to confirme the faith of any. Seing it is thus then, that god therfore worketh mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to confirme his doctrine, and the faith of the beleuers, and the miracles could not work ſuch effects if they were not openly ſeen, to what purpoſe then shuld, Ieſus Chriſt, as great and as thick as he was vpon the wood of the croſſe, and as he is preaſently in heauen, be hidden whole vnder a ſmall cake, and a litle wyne, much leſſe without compariſon, then his bodye is, and all his blood? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were it to work this moſt great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that it should not be ſeen, when it were ones done? to what purpoſe were it to work that other, that Chriſt should be whole in the whole ſacrament, and whole in euery parte of the ſacrament, as though he were a ſpirite? to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12148:184"/>
what purpoſe were it to work, that Chriſt should be bodely in heauen, and in earth, here a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on all the aultars where the maſſe is ſaide, to what purpoſe were it that the bread and the wine, should be turned into Chriſts body and blood? To what purpoſe were it, that the withcommes of the bread and the wine should abide without a ſubiect as thoughe they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſubſtances? All theſe moſt great and ſtoniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge myracles, and greater then euer Chriſt wrought, or that euer were hard of muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes be, if Chiſt himſelf should be incloſed bodelie within that ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet not with ſtanding, no one of theſe miracles were euer ſeene, as they are not, nor can be poſsibly ſeene. Seing then that ſuch miracles cannot be ſeen to what end, to what proffit, or to what purpoſe, should they be wrought, when they are not hable nother to confirme Chriſts doctrine, nor oure faith? shall we ſaie that Chriſt wold work miracles, and ſuch miracles as were neauer the greater without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of profit? ſuerly no, if We wold not make god now leſſe wiſe than men, the which if thei haue reaſon, will neauer do a thing that they
<pb facs="tcp:12148:185"/>
be not perſwaded is to purpoſe and profit for ſome end. We muſt then ſaie, that Chriſt is not bodely preſent in the ſacrament, but he is in heauen, where he ſitteth on the right hand of the father, from whence he muſt come, at the latter day, to iudge the liuing and the dead.</p>
            <p>And this may be another reaſon to proue that Chriſt,<note place="margin">The ſixt rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> in as muche as he is man, is not perſonally in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe the article of oure faith ſaith that he is aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he shall come to iudge the liuing a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dead. If Chriſt were really i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what should he nede on the latter day to come ſo farr of, that is to ſay, from heauen, he bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge neerer on the earth? what ells neded, but that he shal goe out of ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated cake, orells hoſte, as they name it, and appere in maieſtie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d glorious. Suerly it nedeth not that a thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge which is nere vs, should come to vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a farr of, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it can not be denied, but a thinge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, may lightlyer and eaſelier (If it be not lett) come to vs then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a farr of, Chriſt therfore is not in the ſacrament, nor there is not made any maner of chaunge of ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:12148:185"/>Another reaſon is this the opinion that ſaith Chriſt is bodely in the ſacrament dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the trueth of Chriſts trew and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodye, therfore it is falſe. It is clere that the Chriſtian religion holdeth for an article of the faith, that Chriſt is a trew, and naturall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luc.</hi> 24,</note> that he hath the very nature of a man, and that he hath a very body and a very ſoule, as other men haue. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe preſently thone and the other, that is to ſay the body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſoule, be glorified: neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theles they be yet a very bodye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a very ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le. For the glorification, taketh not awaie the nature, It maketh it in dede more ꝑfit, but it ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth it not awaie, ſo as it is not the ſelf ſame that it was before, as we vnderſtand by Chriſt himſelf, who being riſen and hauing taken his glorified body, ſaid to his diſciples, behold my hands, and my feet, that it is euen my ſelf. Suerly he should not haue bene the ſelf ſame that he was before if he had not had the ſelf ſame hands the ſelf ſame feet and the ſelf ſame whole body, and the ſelf ſame ſoule that he had before That that opinion which holdeth that Chriſt is bodely in the ſacrament dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
<pb facs="tcp:12148:186"/>
the trueth of Ieſus Chriſts bodye, and his mans nature, I do proue it, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a body hath, two properties or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the firſt is, to haue quantitie, that is to ſay ſome maner of lenght, ſome maner of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dth, and ſome maner if thicknes, and euen as a body hath greater or ſmaller quantitie, ſo much greater, or ſmaler place it occupieth, as by eyperience we may ſee. And his propertie, agreeth and is naturall to euery body, in ſuch ſorte as alſo the glorified bodies do occupye place that is to ſaye, that the greater glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body occupieth greater place, and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe body leſſe place, euen as Chriſt Ieſus when he was riſen, did occupye place, that is to ſay he was in ſo much place as the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, and greatnes of his body was, nor he was not in any leſſ place, then the greatnes of his bodye was For ſo much as that this, that is to ſaie, to be in leſſe place, then the quantitie of the body is, should diminiſhe the trueth of the body.</p>
            <p>The other propertie is to be onely in one place. And theſe properties be in ſuch ſort na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural to a body, that thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not by any meanes be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, and when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeparateth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12148:186"/>
them from the bodye, then shall it be no more a bodye. Theſe among the reſt, be two proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that make the bodye vndyuidehable as the philoſophers ſai, that is to ſaie, thei make that the bodye is an vndyuidehable thinge, that is to ſay, onely one, other this, or that, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cte, and dyuers from other. And that theſe two properties, that is to ſaye, to occupy place, and ſo much as the quantite and greatnes of the body is, and likwiſe that a body cannot be but in one place at ones, and at one tyme, be in ſeparable from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, nor there can be no maner of body that hath them not, whether it beglorified or no.</p>
            <p>We ſpeak not this of oure ſelf onely, for Saint Auguſtine ſaith it in his <hi>57.</hi> epiſtle anſwering to dardanus the bishop, who had made certain queſtions or demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to him, and he anſwering him to one after another, ſayth to the firſt, ſpeaking of Chriſte riſen and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: doubt not (ſayth he) but the man Chriſt Ieſus, is now there, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he shall come. And after a few words, he ſayth, he shall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none other place, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he shall come to iudge the lyuinge and the dead
<pb facs="tcp:12148:187"/>
(and meaneth from heauen) And ſo he shall come by the witnes of the Aungels voice, in the ſelf ſame forme a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſubſtance of flesh in the which he was ſeen go into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the which forme and ſubſtance, in dede he hath geuen immortalitie, but he hath not taken away the nature, we must not think that according to this forme, that is to ſaye, of the flesh, he is ſpred abrode euery where, for we muſt take hede, that we do not, in ſuch ſorte, affirme the godhed of the man, that we should take away the troth of the bodye, for ſo much as it doth not in dede folow that he that is in god, sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be ſo euery where as god. And after a few words he ſaith. God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d man is one perſon, and one Chriſt Ieſus, is thone and thother, In that that he is god, he is euery where, but in that that he is man he is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And after about the middeſt of the Epiſtle, or a litle before, he ſaith: Take the rowmes of places fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they shal not be in any place, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe they shall not be in any place, they shal not be at all, take the ſame bodies, from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of bodies, and there shall be no place, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re they should be, and therfore it is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12148:187"/>
that thei be not. Alſo he ſaith in the <hi>30.</hi> treatiſe vpon Ihon, the lord is aboue, but yet the troth is here, that is to ſai, the lord, becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe that the bodye of the lord, in the which, he is riſen, muſt nedes be in one place, but the troth of the ſame, is ſpred abrode euery whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</p>
            <p>By all theſe words of Augustine we haue ſpecially two thinges. The firſt is that Ieſus Chriſt riſen and glorified, is not in that he is man but in one place, that is to ſay in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, from whence he shall come to iudge the lyuing and dead, in that he is god, he is euery where in the world. The ſecond is, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies of neceſsitie do occupye rowme of place a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d if they did not occupy rowme, they should not be in any place, and being in no place, they should not be any thing at all, but should be nothinge: this groundwork ſtanding that the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe two properties, that is to ſaye that euery body doth occupy ſo much place, as his great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes is, and likewiſe it is not at one tyme but in one place. And theſe two properties cannot be taken from bodyes, And he that wold take them awaye, should bring to paſſe that the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyis
<pb facs="tcp:12148:188"/>
should not be in anye place, as <hi>S.</hi> Auſten ſayth and if they should not be in any place, thei should be nothing: It foloweth neceſſary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if Chriſt were bodely in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for ſomuch as there he should not haue nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one, nor the other of theſe two proꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, It foloweth, I ſay, that Chriſt in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment should not haue a trew bodye, yea no bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye, becauſe that his body (be it where it will, and as it will) it cannot be ſeparatid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe two properties, to a bodie moſt naturall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, according to Auſten a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the troth.</p>
            <p>Here they ſay that it is true (ſpeakinge na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally) that theſe two conditions a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſeparated, from bodies, but ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſupernaturally; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by miracle, they may be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodyes, as in effectt they be ſeparated from Chriſtes bodye in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. To this I anſwer, firſt, that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall properties be neuer chaunged by miracle, let them finde, that god euer did it, let them geue me one onely example. We know that god is almighty and there is no maner thinge that may be done, Impoſsible vnto him, as the Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſayd to Marye, but who knoweth that this thinge may be done? I will not ſtand now, to

diſpute this thinge, I deſier the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they wold geue ſome other example, but they will nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do it. Further I ſay that it belongeth to them to proue that god doth theſe miracles. This is no good reaſon God can do it, therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he hath done it. How many thinges ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god do that he hath not done? God could haue ſent more then twelue legions of Aungels for to delyuer Chriſt out of the Iewces hands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 26.</note> as he himſelf doth witnes in <hi>S.</hi> Mat. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet he ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not. And how many other thinges might we alledge, if we wold, that god can do a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet he doth them not? Thei muſt proue then, that god doth theſe miracles. By Chriſtes ſainges, nor by the ſcriptures, they cannot proue it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that they will alledge, that Chriſt hath ſayd it, that is to ſay, this is my body shewing the bread, and this is my blood shewing the wine: but this is a tryflynge profe, for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Chriſt ment not by this manner of ſpeache to affirme that he is within the bread and the wyne, but ment to ſaye, that both the one, and thother, were ſignes, and a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunces of his body and blood, as plainly we will shew hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12148:189"/>Peraduenture they will ſay, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith there nedeth no profes but men muſt ſtand to the letter. This thinge is of faith therfore it nedeth no profe I ſay that in matters of faith we muſt ſtand to gods worde with the right vnderſtanding of it, and trew ſenſe of the words, nor we muſt not geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other and ſtraunge ſenſes, Contrary to the mynde of the ſpirite. The ſenſe of the ſpirite is not, that Chriſt should be bodelye in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt, and in the cupp, as it is ſayde, but it is that whiche we haue ſaid, and will better ſaye, in the talke that foloweth, where we will decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of ſacramentall ſpeaches, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the ſcripture.</p>
            <p>And to be short that we may end now at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght this reaſoninge, I ſaye that this opinion of the being of Chriſts body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bluode in the ſacrament, doth diminishe the troth of Ieſus Chriſts trew bodye and trew bluode. And it maketh him to haue in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d much more phantaſticall then Martiane, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Manicheus who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpake of Chriſt and apointed him notrew and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall body, but a phantaſticall, and Imaginable,

orels a ſeming bodie, they ſaied things leſſe ſtriuing againſt nature then this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did neauer deuide Chriſts bodie, nor ſpeak of him things ſo vnimaginable as this opinion doth, nor they neauer ſaid that he was in two places at ones. This opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maketh him to be (in that he is man) In infinite places, nor they neauer ſaid, that a great bodie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in ſo litle a thinge as theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo we wil ſaie of the other ſo many Imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which the forſaid opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> placeth. And yet tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ugh Manicheus a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Martia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did ſay theſe or like things, as they ſay, It should haue bene leſſe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeinge they did apoint him a fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke and a ſemeable bodie. But this opinion affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming that Chriſt hath a trew and a naturall body in the ſacrament doth yet ſpeake ſuch things of him, as neather can be in dede, nor be not Imaginable, and be without all reaſon, without alſo gods worde, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more reprowea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble (as to this) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fore ſaid opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne) of Manicheus and Martion, and without doubt they ſpeak things diſagreing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.

becauſe the one and thother, is a ſacrament and is made for remembrance, the lamb was ordeined in remembrance of that paſſouer of the aungell that was in Egipt, the bread and the wine, in remembraunce of Chriſts body and bluod, geuen for oure raunſominge.

that is to ſay, ſpiritually, and ſacramentally the which ſacramentall eating therfore, as we haue ſaid, ſerueth and is profitable to the ſpirituall eating. I do not fynde after what other ſort, except theſe two, we may eat Chriſt and drink his bluod. But to eat Chriſt and drink his bluod, after thes two ſortes, we nede not to put him really into the mouth, nother his body nor his bluod, therfore it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Chriſt shuld be really in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

the receauing him ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally that he shuld be really in the ſacrament, I proue it by the Apoſtle paule who ſaith to the Cor. that the hebrue is he people were baptiſed, aſwel they,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 10</note> as we althoughe vnder other ſignes then ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, becauſe that we be baptiſed with water and that people ſayth paule was baptiſed with the cloude dni with the ſea, paſsing thorow the middeſt of the read ſea, and that cloude that couered them and the red ſea thorow the middeſt wherof thei al paſſed, was to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſinge, where we may note that according to paule, not onely they of full age were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but the children alſo, becauſe that all were couered with the cloude a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all paſſed thorow the middeſt of the ſea.

And yet not withſtanding they did not eat Chriſts body nor drink his bluod really, putting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in to the mouth: What is the cauſe that we mai not alſo eate his body, and drink his bluod, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, without eating or drinkinge him really and bodely, forſo much as that to eat or drink Chriſt ſacramentally, is none other but to receaue with the mouth his ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? And to be à ſacrament, it is not nedefull that the thing ſignified should be in the ſame ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, and much leſſe that there should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de any turninge of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the ſignes, And it is enoughe that the ſacrament should be a ſigne of the ſame, that is to ſai, that it should ſignifie it, according to the definition of a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which ſayth <hi>Sacramentum eſt ſacrae rei ſignum,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>A</hi> ſacrament is a ſigne of a holy thinge, It is plaine that Chriſt, as man, was not really in

the hebrues ſacraments, becauſe, he was not yet ether borne or incarnated. And how could his body and his bluod be in thoſe ſacraments ſeing his body and bluod were not yet? And yet paule ſaieth that they did eat the ſelf ſame ſpiritual meat, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſelf ſame ſpiritual drink that is to ſay, Chriſt ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Certein expound paules text, of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eating and drinking of that people, that is to ſaye, by faith but becauſe that all did not eat and drink ſpiritually and by faith, for ſo much as that a great parte of them, as paule affirmeth, in the text were vnbeleuers, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet he ſayth that all did eat the ſelf ſame ſpirituall meat, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d drink the ſelf ſame ſpirituall drink.

And thoughe paule calleth that meat and drink ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rituall, yet he meaneth not that it should be ſpirituall in it ſelf, as that which is of faith is in dede ſpirituall, but he calleth it ſpirituall,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12148:196"/>
as to the ſignification and as to the vſe, that is to ſay, that it was apointed to ſignifie Chriſt, who is a ſpirituall and an holy thinge, as oure ſacraments may be called ſpirituall things, be cauſe they be appointed, to ſpirituall things. There was not withſtanding difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wene thoſe ſacraments a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d oures, becauſe that thei (beſide that they were apointed to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things) ſerued alſo for the bodely things, that is to ſay, to the neceſsitie of the preſent lyfe, for ſo much as the manna and the water were their dayly meat and drink, ſo that they had two vſes the one ſpirituall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to them a ſacrament, the other bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dely the which ſerued to the neceſsitie of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir bodyes. Our ſacraments be not ſo the which be taken onely for the ſpirituall vſe that is to ſay, for ſacraments, and not for the neceſsitie of the body.</p>
            <p>To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude therfore, I ſaie, that ſeing Chriſt ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor drunke but after one of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe two ſorts, that is to ſay ſpiritually and by faith and then ſacramentally alſo. And after theſe two ſortes Chriſt may be receaued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh he be not really, that is to ſay in body
<pb facs="tcp:12148:197"/>
and in ſoule, in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It is not therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re proffitable, and much leſſe neceſſary, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſuch reall being in the ſame ſacrament. They that ſay, that Chriſt is really in that hoſt and in that cup, do not know, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to eat and drink Chriſt ſacramentally, for ſo much as, that to eat and drink ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, as we haue ſaid, is none other but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the ſacrament, that is to ſay, the ſigne of the holy thinge, and doth not meane to take bodely the ſelf ſame thinge, that is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſacrament.</p>
            <p>I might if I wold, and did not feare to be tedious to the readers, make dyuers other rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons alſo, but it nedeth not, and thoſe that we haue made, do ſuffice. But let vs put the caſe, that we had made no one reaſon, to proue this oure negatiue, that is to ſay, that Chriſt is not really in the ſacrament, nor there is not made any turninge of the bread and the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne into his body and bluod, nor that we had not alledged any ſaing of the ſcripture, the which not withſtanding, god ayding vs, we haue ſufficiently done, let vs put the caſe (I ſay) that we had done no one of thoſe things,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12148:197"/>
yet they of the contrary opinion should not, by this, haue had their purpoſe, becauſe that it doth not belong to vs to proue our negatiue, but it belongeth to them to proue there affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue. For eueri one that affirmeth any ſain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d if he ſpeak reaſonably to proue it, If it were not already ſo plaine that euery man might ſee it: He that denyeth is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to proue his negatiue. It is not enough for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of what ſo euer aucthoritie he be, for to be beleued, to ſay it is ſo, the matter ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth thus but he muſt proue his affirmatiue ſainge, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely if it be a matter of weight, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pertaining to faith as this is. Nor it is not enough ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be hable to defend and maintaine it, for ſo much as that many falſe opinions be, with witt, with diſtinctions, with wrangelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and intangelinges defended, as thoughe they were true. We mai ſee this by experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, in the ſchoole doctoures and queſtioniſts, for few or none of them do agree to gether, but they be of contrary and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I deſire then of theſe maner men that they wold proue this their rule or opinion, that is to ſay, that Chriſt is bodely in the ſacrament, and that the ſubstance of the bread, and the wyne be turned into his body and bluod.

            <p>To the which aucthorities I anſwer, and firſt to thoſe of the old doctours, that is to ſay, as for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, of Ireneus, Tertulian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Origen, Hilary, Athanaſius, Baſill, Io<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>h Chriſoſtom, Gregory Nazianzene, Gregory Nicene, Cyrill, Ambroſe Iherom, Auguſtine, And ſuch other holy fathers, the which labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Chriſts church in wrytinge bokes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the ſcripture, diſputinge againſt heretiks, preachinge and teachinge, wherby they do in dede deſerue to be honoured for their lerninge, and holynes, but, I ſay that no one of them, nor of the other anucients, was cauer of this opinion, that Chriſt should be bodely in the ſacrament, and much leſſe, that the ſubſtances of the bread and wyne, should be turned into his body and bluod, but in dede
<pb facs="tcp:12148:199"/>
they haue ſayd the contrary. And thoughe ſomtyme it ſemeth that they should affirme that the bread and the wyne be Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bluode, yet this is for none other cauſe, but that they ſpeak of the ſacraments, after the maner of the ſcripture the which doth call them by the name of the thinges ſignified by them, as we ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finde that Auguſtine did. Who very often hath declared ſuch maner of ſpeches as we will tell here after, And let vs admit alſo that all the old doctours had bene of that opinion, and that all the world wold ſay it yet ought we not to beleue them, if thei bringe not furth the witnes of the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, becauſe that this is a thinge pertaining to faith and, faith is ground wrought onely vpon gods worde, as paule ſaith to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,<note place="margin">

them, be accordinge to the holy ſcripture as the Councell of Nece was againſt Arrius, The councell of Calcedone againſt Eutiches, And certein other old councels, the which had gods word for their rule. And theſe onely were gathered to gether in Chriſts name, and in the holy goſt. But I ſay in dede that whan they determine anye maner of thinge pertaining to fayth, and do not ſtick to gods word, that we ought not to obey ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, nor men ought not to beleue them. And in our dayes, we haue the example of the coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell of Trent, the goodly determinations that it made, all, at the popes good pleaſure, whome the bishoppes cannot gainſay becauſe they haue all ſworne neauer to go againſt the ſea Apoſtolike?

to faith to beleue the hole world together if they do not bringe forth gods worde, that is to ſay, the holy ſcripture for their witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Wel now thei wil ſay, that they haue gods worde, that is to ſaye, Chriſtes words, who ſayd this is my body, and this is my bluod she winge the bread and the wyne, therfore the bread and wyne be turned into Chriſtes body and bluod, and Chriſt is wholly in the hoſt and in the wyne. Further he ſayd thoſe words in the ſixt chapter of Ihon, aboue recyted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he willeth that we should eat his flesh and drink his bluod, and this is not done except in the ſacrament, therfore he is bodely in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. I anſwer firſt to thoſe words, this is my body, and this is my bluod, and I aſke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in the ſcripture at any tyme is found that ſuche a ſpeche, as, This is my bodye and this is my bluode, should meane, this is turned into my body and into my bluod, or els my body and my bluod be in theſe ſignes? I neauer fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und this maner of ſpeche.

of my body shewinge the bread, and this is the ſigne of my bluod, shewinge the wyne, as before we haue ſayd and we will alſo better ſay, in the declaration of thoſe words, This is in dede their meaninge. To the ſaings of the ſixt chapter of Ihon, I ſay, that they do not alledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to purpoſe, becauſe that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Chriſt doth not ſpeak of the ſacramentall eatinge, but of the ſpirituall, and by faith, as in the third reaſon we haue declared, yea as Chriſt him ſelf doth expounde it in the text, and ſo all the old doctours do expounde it, And cheefely Auguſtine who ſayth beleue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thou haſt eaten, ſo that ſeinge that opinion of the turninge of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the bread and wyne into Chriſts body and bluod, nor that of his bodely preſence in the ſacrament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued, nether by reaſon nor any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie that auayleth, we ought to conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de that it is a fayned inuention and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men and commeth not from god.

               </note> Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine ſayth that no myracle happeneth about the ſacrament of Chriſtes body and bluod.

Well it is playne then after Auſtens mynde, that Chriſt is not really in bodye and in ſoule in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but he calleth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crated bread a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wyne Chriſts bodye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bluod

becauſe they be ſignes of his bodye and bluod not that they should be really and in dede his true body and bluod becauſe he will that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe should be in heauen, and not on the earth in the ſacrament. We might if we wold alledge, the other old doctours, as Ireneus, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Ierome, and Chry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoſtome, all the whiche be of the ſelf ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but let S.

leaue out. Then it is playne that the opinion a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the old churche,<note place="margin">Marke.</note> is that which before we haue proued. And we muſt here marke that the old doctours inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir maner of ſpeache to agree with the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, the which whan it ſpeaketh of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doth name them by the name of the thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges ſignified very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they treat of the ſame ſacraments and chefely of the thanks ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uinge, theical it many tymes bodye and bluod and they ſpeak in ſuche ſorte as it ſemeth thei meane to affirme the bodely preſence of the body and bluod in the ſacrament, a thinge that they neauer intended. The which thinge when the late wryters and chefely the ſchole men haue not taken hede to, they haue bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſetfurth the bodely preſence of thone and thother in the ſacrament, but they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, for ſo much as that was neauer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Auntientes.</p>
            <p>And if any one wold bringe furth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of ſacramentes aſcribed to Ambroſe, the which putteth this new opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>delye preſence in the ſacrament. It may be bol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dely anſwered him, that that boke was neauer
<pb facs="tcp:12148:206"/>
Ambroſes, becauſe that neyther the ſtyle of the ſpeche was Ambroſes nor the ſentence, the which is contrary to many his ſainges in his other bokes. Nor let no man maruell, thoughe I denye thoſe bokes to be Ambroſes, for many bokes were aſcribed to the old doctoures that they neauer ſaw, much leſſe made as that boke of the true and falſe repentance, aſcribed to Auſten, the which teacheth againſt Auſten na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minge him and yet certein haue attributed it to him. Certeine men of ſmall conſciences ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue done this other that they might better ſell ſuch bokes, or to make their opinions be bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued and to geue them auctoritie vnder the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me of Auntients, or els for ſome other reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cts ſcant honeſt. It is no ſmall fault to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute vnder other mens auctorities without their conſent to make men beleue their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as it is a great faulte that their laboure and bokes should be attributed to other. And I ſay more alſo againe, that althoughe all the old doctours were of ſuche opinion that is to ſay that Chriſt were bodely preſent in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, we be not bounde, nor we ought not to beleue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, If they proue it not by the holy
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12148:206"/>
ſcripture the which they neauer did nor it can not be done. And this is the ſigne, that as mani as eauer were of this opinion, could neauer hetherto mak reaſon that might auaile. If this bodely preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, had bene true, it should haue bene a thinge much belonginge to faith, and the Apoſtolike wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges wold haue made vs clere, and ſuere of it but we ſee that ſuch a preſence is affirmed in no one place of the ſcripture. Therfore it is not true but it is an inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which ought not to haue any place in gods thinges.</p>
            <p>Now there remayneth to anſwer to their reaſons that hold this bodely preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſt in the ſacrament. They make (as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge we haue ſayde) many profes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but none auayleth. And we will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but to three or foure, whiche haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teine ſmall shew, for anſweringe to theſe few it is an eaſy thinge to anſwer to all the other.</p>
            <p>One and the firſt is this,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon.</note> that is to ſay Chiſt calleth the conſecrated bread his bodye and the wyne his bluod, therfore it is ſo that the bread is his body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wyne his bluod that is
<pb facs="tcp:12148:207"/>
that the bread and the wyne, be turne into his bodye and bluod, or at the leaſt be there really preſent, or els he should haue ſpoken a lye, the which cannot be, ſeing Chriſt is the vndeceaueable troth. This is the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they can make, the which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge is nothinge worth, yea it commeth of an ignoraunce of the maner of ſpeche of the ſcripture, or els if it come not of ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce it procedeth of an obſtinacye and ſelf willednes becauſe they deſire to defend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be (accordinge to the common ſainge) right or wronge, that which ones they haue affirmed, becauſe thei wolde not ſeme to haue erred. I anſwer to this reaſon, and ſaye, that Chriſt ſayd the troth and could not ſpeake an vntroth, becauſe he could not err beinge god. And it is true that the bread is Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and the wyne is his bluod, and I confeſſe it, but it is true as Chriſt ment it, not as they wold haue it. Chriſt when he ſayd this is my bodye shewinge the bread, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this is my bluod shewing the wine, did not entend, nor went not a bout to ſaye that that bread was really, and ſubſtantially, his bodye, and the wyne his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:12148:207"/>
bluod, but he ment to ſay that that bread and that wyne, were a ſacrament and did ſignifie his bodye and his bluod: And he folowed the maner of the ſpeche of the ſcripture, when he ſpeaketh of ſacramentes: you know well yno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh that Chriſt alwayes did honoure the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſcripture, alledginge it very often, and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uokinge men to the ſame. And therfore becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he knew that the cuſtome of the ſcripture is to name the ſacraments, and call them, by the name of the things ſignified, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by them, he alſo deſired to vſe that maner of ſpeche, callinge the bread and the wyne his body and bluod, becauſe they did ſignifie both the one and the other, that is to ſay, he called the bread his bodye, becauſe it did ſignifie his bodye, and the wyne his bluod becauſe it did ſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gnifie his bluod, as before S. Auguſtine hath ſayde.</p>
            <p>That the cuſtome of the ſcripture is to call the ſacraments by the name of the thinges ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnefied by them, it is eaſelye proued, and we haue alreadye ſene it in the former talk. The circunciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was a ſacrament of the hebrewish people, and becauſe it was a ſacrament, the
<pb facs="tcp:12148:208"/>
ſcripture doth call it couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe it was the ſigne of gods couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his of ſpringe, as it is written in geneſis where god doth firſt call it, the ſigne of the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenaunt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after a few words, he calleth it the couenaunt. The couenaunt was this, that god wold be the god of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of his ſeed, that is to ſay, of his of ſpringe. It is a plaine matter that the circunciſion was not really this coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naunt, or promeſſe, and yet god doth call it co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenaunt, becauſe it was the ſigne of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, should we ſaye that the circunciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in dede gods couenaunt becauſe god called it by this name couenaunte? Sewerly no, but we muſt ſay, if we will ſaye well, that therfore god calleth it ſo, becaus the ſame is a ſigne of gods couenaunt, or els of gods promeſſe. And if ani should ſay what meaneth it that god did vſe this maner of ſpeche, Could not he vſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per maner of ſpeche and not the improper? To this I anſwer, that god often tymes vſeth with vs the cuſtome of men, becauſe we be men and he agreeth to oure maner of ſpeche, for ſo muche as the cuſtome is amonge men, that they call the ſignes of a thinge, by the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12148:208"/>
ſelf ſame name, of the ſame thinge ſignified. As for example, If at any tyme we should ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke a couenaunt or an agrement with any man as ſone as the agreement and couenaunt is made, we cauſe to be made, an inſtrument or a wrytinge of ſuch agrement, and we call it co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenaunt or els agrement, not that, that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment is really ſuch agreement (for the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt and agrement, went before) but becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it is a ſigne of ſuch couenaunt and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment So we call the wrytinge of a ſale or of a purchaſe, a ſale or purchaſe, becauſe it is a ſigne and confirmacion of the ſale or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. And we do call the wrytinge or the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch thinges, teſtament, or legacie, or gift, becauſe it is the ſigne and confirmaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe thinges. Let vs geue an other example which alſo is of the ſcripture. In Exodus and in many other places, the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the paſchall lambe, is called paſſouer. And Chriſt and the Apoſtels did ſo call it. Chriſt ſayd in ſaynet luke, I haue erneſtly deſired, to eat this paſſouer, before I ſuffer. Here Chriſt called the paſchall lamb paſſouer.
<pb facs="tcp:12148:209"/>
And the Apoſtells ſaid to Chriſt, where willt thou that we prepare for the to eat the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And for all that, the paſchall lamb was not really the paſſouer, becauſe the paſſouer as we haue in the ſame Exodus, was that paſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge (as it is alſo ſayd before in the ninth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) the which the Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell made whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſtrake the firſt borne of Egypt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d paſſed by the hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes of the hebrues. Now that paſſage, was properly, the paſſouer. But becauſe the lamb was ordeined, that it should be killed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaten, with many ceremonyes in ſigne and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that thinge, therfore the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth it paſſouer.</p>
            <p>Behold how the ſcripture calleth the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, by the names of the thinges repreſented and ſignified, why shall we maruell then that Chriſte did call the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated bread his body and the wyne his bluod, becauſe they ſhould be ſignes and a remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his body and bluod? We ought not to maruell, yea it is oure great rudenes and dulnes that we ſee not this thinge, and why he hath done it, that is to ſaie whye he calleth the bread his body and the wyne his bluod. Euery man ſayth that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12148:209"/>
of thanks geuinge doth come in ſtede of the ſacrament of the paſchall lambe. And if it be ſo, ſeinge that the ſcripture and the Apoſtels call the ſame ſuch lamb paſſouer yea Chriſt him ſelf in the ſame ſupper when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ſacrament of his body and bluod, called that lambe paſſouer, not for any other cauſe, but for that it was a ſigne and a remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>braunce of the paſſouer, why should not the bread be called the body and the wyne the blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, becauſe they be ſignes and a remembraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the bodye and the bluod: euen as the lam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be is called paſſouer, becauſe it is the ſigne and remembraunce of the paſſouer. And that rock out of which came furth the water in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, paule calleth it Chriſt, not for any other cauſe, but for that it did ſignifie Chriſt, nor the<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re was neauer any men that bi ſuch a ſainge wold think that paule ment to affirme, that that ſtone was really Chriſt, but that he ment onely to ſay that it did ſignifie Chriſt. So likewiſe let vs ſaye of the bread and the wyne, that they be called body and bluod, becauſe they be ſignes and a remembraunce of ſuch thinges. We haue bene longe in anſweringe
<pb facs="tcp:12148:210"/>
to this reaſon becauſe in dede the whole conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteth in this declaration that we haue made.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon is this, If Chriſt were not really in the ſacrament <hi>S.</hi> Paule wold not haue ſayde that it should be condemnation to them that should take it vnworthelye, nor he wold not haue ſayde, that ſuch should be giltie of the lords bodye and bluod. For ſo much as that if Chriſt be not in the ſacrament, there should not be any other thinge but bread and wyne, and beinge none other thinge there, it should not be to vs ſuch condemnacion, as it is in dede no conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation to eate other come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread and to drink other wyne. To this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that therfore paule ſayth that they be giltye of the lords body and bluod, the which do take the conſecrated bread and wyne and the ſacrament vnworthelye, not for becauſe that eather the body or the bluod be in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but they be therfore giltye of the one and the other, becauſe thei diſpiſe Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath thei diſpiſe his body and bluod, not goinge with that faith and with that reuerence that they ought to take thoſe holy ſignes Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt in remembraunce of his body
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12148:210"/>
and bluod geuen to death for oure raunſome. In old tyme thei that did diſpyſe or dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the name or the glory of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thei were gyltie of treaſon againſt the ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te of Rome. And they that had done wronge to Ceſars Image or els had defaced any of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars writings, This was as if thei had layd vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent hands vpon the princes perſone. He that wold dishonoure the armes or the badges, of any great ſtate, that prince wold haue eſtemed ſuch dishonoure and diſworship to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt his oune perſon, for when his bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or els his Armes be dyſpyſed he him ſelf is diſpyſed. So ſeinge that Ieſus Chriſt the chefe prince of the world hath Inſtituted the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall bread and wyne, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that that it should be a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of ſo great a thinge, and should repreſent ſo great a miſterye, that is to ſay, that hath geuen his body and his bluod, and dyed for to deliuer vs from ſinn and from euerlaſtinge death, and to geue vs euerlaſtinge lyfe: Sewerly they that will take theſe holy ſignes withoute true repentaunce of there ſinnes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:12148:211"/>
true faith, and without conſideration of ſo great a miſterie and benefite they make no counte, nother of Chriſtes body nor his bluod nor of his death, no nor of Chriſte himſelf. it is no maruell therfore, that they, who go to take ſuch a ſacrament vnworthelye, do eate and drinke Iudgement, that is to ſay condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe when they diſpyſe the ſignes of ſo great thinges, they do conſequently diſpyſe the ſame thinges, and him alſo that did inſtitute ſuch ſignes. It is not proued by this that Chriſt is encloſed in this ſacrament, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The third reaſon.</note>The third reaſon the which ſemeth to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſome shew is this, that is to ſay that if Chriſt were not here in this ſacrament, there should not be wrought any ſuch great myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as men ſee. Sometyme it is ſeen that the hoſtes haue caſt out bluod and ſuch bluod is kept in many places. It is red in the lyfe of Saint Gregorie, that the conſecrated bread maruelouslye chaunged into a mans finger. It is red that that the brute beaſtes did knele doune at the preſence of the thankes geuinge. And ſomtyme there apered a childe when the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12148:211"/>
hoſt was liſted vp. What shallbe ſayde to the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe great myracles, ſewerlye if Chriſt were not in the ſacrament god wold neauer haue wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught theſe great ſignes.</p>
            <p>This reaſon is nothinge worth, and it is li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke the reaſon that they make, that defended purgatorie with ſaing that there was heard certaine lamentable voices of the ſoules of the dead which deſired help of there parents or frends, that they wold cauſe to be ſayd maſſes and chefely thoſe maſſes that be called Saint Gregories, and as ſone as they were ſayd tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe voyces were heard no more. It is told alſo in the lyfe of a certeyne ſeinct (but in dede a fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars ſaincte) that he ſaw ones a valley full of ſoules, the which deſired help, and that ſeinct was moued to pytye of thoſe poore ſoules. I leaue to you to thinke how many thoſe ſoules ought to be, that filled that valleye, when he had ſayd I cannot tell how many maſſes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not well remember the ſtorye) he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turned to ſe the vally and he found them no more there, becauſe they were delyuered out of purgatorye. I do much maruell that all the ſoules in purgatorye went not thether into
<pb facs="tcp:12148:212"/>
that vally that thei all might haue bene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by that ſainctes Maſſes. Ergo there is a purgatorye. What will the lutheranes that de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye purgatorye ſay here what will they ſaie? Thei that you call lutherans, will ſai that you be a blynde ſorte of ſuperſtitious, I will not ſai ignoraunt Idiots of gods cauſes, and that you haue no faith in Chriſte, thinkinge that the materiall fier, can do that to the ſoules, that onely Chriſt hath done with his pretious blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od that is to ſaye to purge them, and perfectly to ſatiffie gods iuſtice for all the ſinnes of the beleuers. And they will ſaye that you deſerue to be begyled, and mocked by the deuell, that leadeth you to think that the ſoules of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad do lament and deſire maſſes, and ye percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not that he is the ſame wicked ſpirite, the which fayneth himſelf to be the ſoules of the dead, and deſireth help, and caryeth aboute youre brayne, and maketh you beleue that glow wormes be lanternes, The ſoules of the dead go not a ſolaſinge here a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there (as Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoſtome vpon <hi>S.</hi> Mathew, ſaith very well) but thei abyde in there places apointed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thoſe ſoules of the faithfull and godlye abyde

            <p>Euen ſo I ſaye of theſe maner myracles (thoughe thei weare in dede) that thei be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne other but illuſions and diſceyts of ſathan, for to geue credit to the Maſſe, and to beinge to paſſe that we should not beleue ſewerly in Chriſte. And god by his iuſt iudgement doth ſuffer theſe diſceyts, becauſe we will not receaue the knowledge of the troth nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the holy goſpell. And for this moſt great ſinne, he will that we shall beleue lyes, and be deceaued. Nor ſewerly we deſerue none other, but to receaue and allow Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes myracles, as ſainct paule ſayth to the Theſſalonicenſes,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2.</note> ſeing that we will not ſtand to gods worde.

               <note place="margin">the fourthe reaſon.</note>They make another reaſon, the which I wold haue ſayd nothinge of, becauſe it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwered, yet for ſo much as they brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein with the ſame, certeine examples or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litudes to geue a coloure to their opinion, of the which we haue not yet ſpoken we will ſaie of them a few words to the greather and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re plentifull clerenes of the truthe. They ſaye, that god can bringe it to paſſe, that is to ſaie, that whole Chriſt great a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thick as he was on the Croſſe, should be in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that he should be whole in euery parte of the ſame as the ſoule is whole in the whole bodye, and whole in euery parte of the bodye, and that he should be as man, in many places, in heuen on
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:12148:213"/>
earth vpon all altares, and in euery other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce where the ſacrament of thanks geuinge is. He can turne one body into another, as shall ſeme good and lik him, becauſe he is almighty, then he can make that the bread shalbe turned into his bodye, and the wyne into his bluod. Seing he could create the world of nothinge, he can much eaſelyer chaunge one thinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. They geue eyample of Moyſes rodd, the which was turned into a ſerpent and then the ſerpent was turned againe into the rod likewiſe the waters of Egypt were turned into bluod.</p>
            <p>Concerninge the being of whole Chriſt in the ſacrament, as great and thick, as he is in heauen, they geue the ſimilitude of the heauen which we ſee, the which being ſo great, is not withſtandinge whole in oure litle eye. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe oure whole face, apereth in a glaſſe that is much leſſe then the face is, yea the whole man, is ſeen in a litle glaſſe. Concerning the being of whole Chriſt in euery parte of the ſacrament, they gyue the ſimilitude of oure ſoule, as we haue already ſayd the which is whole in the whole and whole in euery parte
<pb facs="tcp:12148:214"/>
of the body Oure face alſo is whole in the whole glaſſe and whole in euery parte of the glaſſe, after this ſorte, that is to ſaye, that if the glaſſe should be broken in many partes, oure whole face wold apere in euery one of them. Concerning Christes bodely beinge in many places, that is to ſay in heauen, on the earth and in euery place where the ſacrament is, they geue the ſimilitude of a man the which should haue about him many glaſſes in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of theſe glaſſes the forme of a man will apere. Likwiſe if one ſpeak in the preſence of many perſons, his voice is but one, and yet it is whole in dyuers mens eares. If nature bringe this to paſſe, that is to ſaye, that one thinge may be in dyuers places, much more Chriſt who is god the maker of nature can bringe it to paſſe in his body, that is to ſaye that firſt the bread, should be turned into his bodye and the wyne into his bluod, and after, then that it should be whole in the whole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte and in the cupp, and whole in euery parte of the ſacrament, and that it should be in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places, If he can do thoſe thinges, and will doo them, as we vnderſtand by the words of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12148:214"/>
the ſacrament, the whiche ſay, this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye shewing the bread, and this is my bluod sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I anſwer firſt to the reaſon it ſelf, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I will ſpeake of the ſimilitudes, To the reaſon, that is to ſay if god can do it, therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he hath done it, I ſay that it awayleth not, and it is already anſwered before in oure ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth reaſon that god doth not all that he can do, as we geue the example of the twelue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſand legions of Aungels the which god if he wold, could haue ſent to help Chriſt, and yet he ſent them not. God can bringe to paſſe that we all maie walke vpon the ſea without shippes as ſome tyme Chriſt did, And as it is written in the boke of wyſdom, and yet he doth it not. Oure queſtion is not whether god can do it or no, but it is whether god hath done it or no. Thei ſaiyes and we ſaye
<pb facs="tcp:12148:215"/>
no, It belongeth to them to proue that he hath done it and that he doth it a fresh, the which they shall neauer do nor can neauer bringe it to paſſe by gods word, this is a ſuer rule. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge that they go aboute to ſaye, that god had deſire to do it, this is not onely falſe but moſt falſe. What reaſon is this, Chriſt ſayd this is my body shewinge the bread, and this is my bluod shewinge the wyne, therfore he will that the bread should be turned into his body and the wyne into his bluod, or at the leaſt that he should be in the ſacrament, in ſuch ſort as they ſay? This reaſon doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue any anſwer, for ſo much as Chriſt by theſe words, ment not to ſaye any other but that the bread and the wyne, were a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ſignes of his body and bluod and ment not to ſaye that which they affirme, as before we haue ſo often declared.</p>
            <p>The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples or ſimilitudes that they brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge furth be not to the purpoſe, and thei be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſsimilitudes then otherwiſe. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Moyſes rodd turned into the ſerpent, and after the ſerpent turned into the rod, and of the waters turned into bluod, it is not like,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12148:215"/>
becauſe the ſerpent,<note place="margin">Note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in turninge of Moyſes rod, of the water into bluod and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unge of the thinges, which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in the tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note> into the which the rodd was turned, was not before, but was newly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. Likewiſe that bluod into the which the waters were turned was newlye made, and was not before, but Chriſtes body and his blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od were and be, before the bread. They put certayne turninges against nature, not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous but rather monſtrous and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Let them geue me but one example in the hole ſcripture, that god eauer turned one thinge into another that was before, they shall not fynde it. How dare they then be ſo bold to affirme ſuch a thinge yea that which is more, to go aboute to make men beleue it as an article of the fayth and yet thei cannot ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ather proue it by gods worde, nor bringe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th any example, that eauer any lyke thinge was done? The example of the heauen that it is in oure eye which is litle, is nothinge wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, becauſe the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not really in oure eye but there is onely the image or the ſimilitude of the heauen the which ſimilitude is litle, as the eye, nor it is not vnconuenient that the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or the Image of a great thinge shuld be litle, as the Image of Ceſar was in the coyne
<pb facs="tcp:12148:216"/>
that was shewed to Chriſt by the phariſees, the Image of Ceſar was in that coyne the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch was much leſſe then Ceſar himſelf and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles it did repreſent Ceſar who was gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at and much greater then that Image. We will ſay the like of the Image of the man in the glaſſe the which althoughe that it be muche leſſe then the man, yet it doth repreſent the man. This is no great matter, that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of agreat thinge should be litle, but it sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be agreat matter that agreater body sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be conteined in one much leſſe as they ſay of Chriſt, that great and thick as he was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wood of the croſſe, and as preſently he is in heauen, he should be whole conteyned in a litle cake. They that geue theſe examples of heauen and of the thinges that be ſeen in glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do not proue that agreat bodye is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a litle as they ſay of Chriſt, that he is conteyned in the hoſte, but they proue onely the Image or ſimilitude of agreat thinge may be whole in a litle thinge, the which we denie not, but if the ſimilitude or image of agreat thinge be in a litle thinge, this is becauſe, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12148:216"/>
that Image it ſelf alſo is litle and no greater then that body wher in it apereth, yea it is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſo that theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples be not to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To the other ſimilitudes I ſay alſo that they auayle not, that of the ſoule that it sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be whole in the whole bodye, and whole in euery parte of the bodye. This is becauſe the ſoule ſeing that it geueth lyfe to all the bodye as it is playne, muſt nedes be in euery parte of the bodye for ſo much as that ſeinge it geue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th lyfe not onely to the whole body, but to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery parte of the ſame. It is neceſſarye that it should be in all the partes, becauſe that if it were not in any parte, that parte should not be a lyue, And becauſe that the ſoule, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eauer it is, of neceſſitye it muſt be whole the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re being vndyuidable and not hauing partes becauſe it is a ſpirite, there fore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the ſoule be whole in the whole, and whole in euery parte of the body, but Chriſtes body not being a ſpirite, and hauinge many partes beinge longe, brode, and thinke, cannot be whole in the whole, and whole in euery parte of the place where he is, and as it is repugnaunte, to a bodye to be a ſpirite
<pb facs="tcp:12148:217"/>
ſo is it repugnant to it to be vndeuydhable in a place. To the other ſimilitude of oure face, the which is whole in the whole and whole in euery parte of the glaſſe after this ſorte, that is to ſaye, that when the glaſſe is broken, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the face is in euery peece of the glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. I ſay they be deceaued, nor it is not true that one Image is in all thoſe peeces of the glaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe, when it is broken, but there be manye Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſo many as there be peeces of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken glaſſe, deuyded the one from the other. It is true in dede that they be like, but thei be not the ſelf ſame as the ſelf ſame bodye of Chriſt is in all the peeces, after their Imagination.</p>
            <p>To the other two exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples with the which they wold proue, that one thinge may be in many places, I ſaye to the firſt, that is to ſaye, to that which ſaieth that the Image of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be in diuers glaſſes, if a man were ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute with many glaſſes, for ſo much as that the Image of the ſame man shalbe in euery one of thoſe glaſſes. I ſay that thoſe Images that shalbe in dyuers glaſſes shall not be one onely but as many as there shalbe glaſſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that they shalbe like, and therfore the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:12148:217"/>
example auayleth not, It had bene behouefull if it should haue auayled, that one ſelf Image and no more should haue bene in dyuers glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the which is falſe. To the laſt example the which ſayth, that one ſelf voyce is in dyuers eares, therfore one bodelye thinge may be in dyuerſe places. I anſwer, that that voyce the which is heard is one and no mo, but I denye that the ſelf ſame is in dyuers eares, yea I ſai, that that which is earde is not in any eare but is in the eyre next to him that ſpeaketh, It is true in dede that the ſimilitude of the ſame voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce is there in their eares that heare, but that ſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>militude is not one, but as many as the eares be that heare, and this is like the thinge that is ſeen. As for example, many eies ſee one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and that face which is ſeene is no more but one, neuertheles in dyuers eyes that ſee the face, be dyuers Images and that Image that is in one eie, is not in an other. And ſo is it of the voyce, theſame is one, but it is not in the eares. And the Images be dyuers, which do re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſent the voyce that is in the ayre, and it is behouefull that thoſe Images should be as ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny as the eares be which heare. I haue made
<pb facs="tcp:12148:218"/>
this longe talke of theſe examples, the which peraduenture, to ſome shall ſeme ſuperfluous yet I deſired to do it, for to make the Vnlerned vnderſtand that all the examples which they can bringe forth be not to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Laſte of all we will tell you one obiection that they make, that is to ſaye, Chriſt ſayd that he whold be with vs vntill the end of the world this to be with vs here beneath, is for that he is in the ſacrament, and dwelleth with vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge in the churches, Incloſed with in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes and litle cloſets. O poure and wretched people that will hyde Chriſte vnder lock and keye as the Iewes did, that thought to kepe him well in the ſealed tombe, that he should not be ſtolen awaye. You haue kept him many hundreth yeres in ſuch ſorte shut vpp, that ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re predeceſſoures could not ſee him, yet at the laſt (by gods goodnes) he is not onely come a brode, but he hath broken youre shettinges and doth shew his merye and godlye counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce to his, that is to ſay to them that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to ſee him and he hath put you in ſuch fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12148:218"/>
that you wote not what to do, you wold yet ones againe Impriſon him but there is no meane to do it. Do what you will, yea and can apoinct, deuyſe, gather councells againſt him, folow youre foregoers that crucified him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and take his members, euell handell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, make them rott in priſon, as ye haue alredye made ſome of them, torment them after ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye and crewell whayes, and kill them, yet you shall not auaile. But by theſe meanes you shall make him more shyninge and glorious. It muſt nedes be o Antichriſtes that you sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld loſe, ſtryuinge with him that is kinge of kinges, and lord of lords,</p>
            <p>I anſwer them, that when Chriſte ſayd to his diſciples in the name of the whole churche I will be with you vntill the ende of the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, he ment not to ſaye that he should be with vs in the ſacrament, no, but he ment to ſaye that he wold be with vs, with his help that he would be with vs with his poure and with his ſpirite, to the entent that the Apoſtels, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtells, we should not think whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he aſcended into heauen, and as to the bodely
<pb facs="tcp:12148:219"/>
preſence, for ſoke the earth that he did forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke both them and vs, or had no more care of vs, as to the helpinge vs. And therfore he ſayd I will be with you vntill the end of the world, euen as the ſonne although it be bodely in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen ſeparate from the earth, yet as to the power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d help, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as to do it good it doth not forſake it, becauſe it geueth it light, it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, it maketh it ſpringe, it maketh the tre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es flowre couereth and deckith them with lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, it maketh them bringe forth frute, it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the generation of beaſtes, and it is as it were a lyfe, of all the bodyed thinges, So doth Chriſt notwithſtandinge that he is in heauen, much higher the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonn, yet he doth not ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore forſake vs, but he hath ſuche care of vs, that he doth help vs, and worketh in vs, with his holie ſpirite and godly poure, much more noblye a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d effectuously, then the ſonne doth in all the bodyed thinges, becauſe without him we can doo nothinge but ſinne, and he helpeth vs muche more effectuously, then if he were on the earth. And therfor he ſayd to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that it was expedient that he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into heauen, as it is written in Ihon. He
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:12148:219"/>
lighteth vs inwardly, he conuerteth vs, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, maketh vs ſtronge, geueth vs fayth, and loue, increaſeth both the one a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the other, he geueth vs truſt and hope in god, he geueth vs ioye and myrth in ſpirite, he geueth vs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience and euery vertue. And to be shorte he worketh euery good thinge in vs, and fulfilleth euery thinge in all, as it is written to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, where he his compared to the head,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1 <hi>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> 4</note> the which powre thin and geueth vertue, ſtrenght and workinge to all the members, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the beinge of euery one of them. Be hold after what ſorte Chriſts ſainge is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand? And they that expounde it of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes preſence in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t do not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, yea I ſai that thei do greatly diminish Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes meaning, becauſe they draw doune the hartes of men, the which god and Chriſt wold, shuld be on hye and lifted vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is one of the cheifeſt cauſes, why Chriſt Ieſus wold aſcend into heauen and not any lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger be conuerſant on earth, to thentent that they should folow the councell yea commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of paule, the which (as before in the eight reaſon we haue ſayd) writinge to the

            <p>We think, yea we be certayne, that thus farr we haue playnely proued, and shewed, manye wayes that Chriſt Ieſus is not bodelye in the ſacrament of thankes geuinge (or the lords ſupper as paule calleth it) and that there is muche leſſe made in the ſame anye ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall turninge of the bread and the wyne into his body and bluod. And we haue made it ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that the opinions whiche affirme ſuch thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be falſe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d erroneous. There remayneth now in the end to ſee who were the auctoures

of thoſe ſtrainge and phantaſticall Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wherby they were moued to fynde them oute ſeinge they be withoute all reaſon and contrarye to Chriſtes mynd, and the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le holy ſcripture.</p>
            <p>I haue not yet heatherto bene hable to know, whan this opinion of the reall and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely being of Ieſus Chriſte in the ſacrament, did beginne. It apereth that aboute the yere of oure lorde <hi>877.</hi> or about the tyme of pope Iohn the eight or a litle before, men began to diſpute about that matter.

But one lanfranck of pauia bishop of Canterbery in England, ſo much preuayled with his auctoritie, with Pope Leo the nynth and
<pb facs="tcp:12148:221"/>
ſo much perſuaded him, that in the councell of vercels, he cauſed the ſayd Ihon ſcotuſſes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and berengarionſes opinion who followed him, to be condemned. And it was ordeined in that councell that men ought to beleue not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely Chriſtes preſence in the ſacrament, but the turning of the bread and the wyne into his body and bluod. And this was as Mat. palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius and Iohn lucidus Samothenus in the amen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dements of the tymes ſaye, in the yere of the lord. <hi>1052.</hi> ſo that it is now iuſt. <hi>500.</hi> yeares ſence this new opinion of the turninge of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the bread and the wyne into Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes bodye and bluod was firſt determined.</p>

And afterward a nother tyme in Rome, by pope Nicholas the ſecond, who compelled Beringarius to recant, and make a beaſtly and shamefull confeſsion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own true confeſsion. Beringarius recantation is put in the decree of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the .ij. diſtinction, capite <hi>Ego berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi> where he confeſſeth and affirmeth that he beleueth with the church of Rome that the bread and the wyne, which be ſet on thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, be not onely a ſacrament, but alſo they be the true body and bluod of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that he is not only in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

Doo ye think that this was a godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion that they compelled this holy man Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringarius to make, the which confeſſeth that Chriſt is in deede ſenſibly handeled, that is to ſay towched, and broken with the prieſtes han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, and than after,<note place="margin">This hoſt was ſuch one as beleued all things.</note> that he is knawed in to mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſels with the teeth of the faythfull?

But the ſame (to be broken in peeces and to be knawed into
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:12148:222"/>
morſels, can not be ſaid but of the ſacrament only, <hi>A</hi> good gloſe that ſpeaketh contrary to the text. This gloſe hath .ij. faultes. Firſt it ſpeaketh againſt the auctor, that is to ſay aga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inſt the maſter of the ſentences him ſelf, who geueth it, becauſe he will that Chriſt shuld be in the ſacrament, vndyuydably, whole in the whole, and whole in euery part of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it be ſoo, how can he be towched and handled with the prieſtes handes? For ſomoch as that the thing which is handled, is felt with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and if it be felt, it muſt nedes be hote or cold, moiſt or drie, hard or ſoft, rough or ſmoth, who did euer touch Chriſtes body ſyns it aſcended into heauen, and dyd euer feele it whether it were whote could or of what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie it should be? If the maſter of the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had ſaid that the withcommes of the bread and the wyne be handled with handes, he had ſayd true according to his opynion, becauſe that the greatnes of the bread, and the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commes of it, may be felt with handes, but the withcommes of Chriſtes body can not be felt. Therfor Chriſtes body can not be handled with the prieſtes handes. Further if
<pb facs="tcp:12148:223"/>
Chriſts body in the ſacrament may be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with handes, why should it not be ſeene? It is playne that euery thing that is felt, may alſo be ſeene, if it be not a thorow shewer as the ayer is. But who did eauer ſee Chriſt in the ſacrament? Thother fault of theſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe is, that it ſpeaketh againſt the text. For the text of beringarius confeſſion, ſayth expreſly, that not only the ſacrament, but Chriſts body and bluod, be ſenſibly handled with the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes handes, be broken and knawed to morſels with the teeth of the faithfull. Theſe wordes cannot haue that ſenſe, that the maſter of the ſentences geueth them, becauſe that the body and the bluod, be playnely ſpoken of, and he ſayth in the text, that they be broken, and gna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wed into morſels, with the faythfuls teeth.</p>
            <p>Further it is not to be thought that they who were preſent at that confeſsion, did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the wordes otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the open and lettered ſignification. For ſo moch as that in confeſsions men muſt chefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſpeake playnely, and not in ſuch ſort as it should be neceſſary to gyue them gloſes and expoſitions, but thei ought to be ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:12148:223"/>
many faſt, and farr from any doubt. And ſo moch the more as they that compelled him to make that confeſsion, did wirt it them ſelues as it lyked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is ſayd that a certen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Humbertus cardinall of burgony, worded or if you will ſo call it, framed that confeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, O Capernites: This is the honor that thei did to Chriſt, to conſtraine a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that Chriſt, who is immortall, and vnſuffera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, should be ſenſibly handled, and broken with the prieſtes handes, and chawed and gna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued into morſels, with the teeth of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

            <p>what the cauſes should be that haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the deuyſers of theſe opinyons of Chriſtes bodyly preſence in the ſacrament, and of the turning of the bread and the wyne into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body and bluod, to Imagin ſuch things, I ſay, in my Iudgsment that they be chefely .ij.
<pb facs="tcp:12148:224"/>
The firſt is the ignorance of the maners of ſpeach of the holy ſcripture, becauſe they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not exercyſed in the ſame, and they did ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gen, when Chriſt ſayd this is my body, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the bread, And this is my bluod shewing the wyne, that ſuch a maner of ſpeach cold not be true except that bread and that wyne, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſubſtantially, and beingly, the very body a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the very bluod of Chriſt, or at the leaſt, that the one and thother, that is to ſaie Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy and bluod, were with in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thei ſawe that the words were clere, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide alſo, that the old doctours many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes did affirme and call the breade and the wyne, body and bluod, they thought that that was the mynd, as well of the ſame doctor as of the holy ſcripture, the which thing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was neuer ſo. And thei conſidered not that the ſame ſcripture whan it treateth of ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſpeak after that ſort that is to ſay, to call the ſacraments by the name of the things ſignified, as allredy we haue befor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes told, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the doctors likwyſe folow the ſame maner of ſpeach, this I think is one cauſe why thei did ſo vtter it.

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gs ꝑtaining to faith, the which euery one sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to beleue, as an article of the faith.

            <p>Thomas of aquyne in his hymne of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the lords body, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bluod ſayth the lyke, that is to ſaie, the word flesh, that is to ſai, the ſonn of god made man, with the word, doth make bread flesh, and the wyne is made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes bluod, and though the ſenſe doo fayle to eſtablish a pure hart, yet faith only is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. And next after he ſayth, let him put to faith as a help, for the fayling of the ſenſes. Theſe .ij. men wold that opinion should be bele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued as an article of the faith, but if they haue beleued it, as an article of the faith, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir wordes doo affirme, ſurely they haue sly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtly and euel fauordly beleued, becauſe that nothing ought to be beleued as an artycle of the faith, except it be found expreſſely in the ſcripture. Let them tell me then, where is the ſcripture that they alledge? Where is gods
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:12148:225"/>
word on which they grownd their faith? Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld we beleue theſe doctours that make thear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the faith without gods word, that bilde their bilding vpon the ſand and not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſure rock? The firſt cauſe, I ſay, of ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynions, was the ignorance of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſecond cauſe without comparayſon is moch wors than this, And parauenture it shall appeare to ſome that I am of an euell mynd, thinking ſo moch euel as I doo of the auctours of ſuch opinions. But if thei will con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider the diſceightes, the craftes, and the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of abuſes that be malytiously committed in the maſſe, thei will ſai ſurely that I am yet to gentle, that I think not moch wors. What good ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be thought of the beginning of ſo gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at an error, from whens doth procede ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconueniences and diſorders?</p>
            <p>The ſecond cauſe, I ſay, that I imagine, is this, that is to ſaie that thei deſired to gyue credite to the priuate maſſe, that is to ſay to that maſſe, where he that ſaith it onely, taketh the ſacrament and doth not deale it to the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple. We muſt vnderſtand that in old tyme, the maſſe was not ſaid as it is now ſaid, as before
<pb facs="tcp:12148:226"/>
we haue noted in the bocke of the Anatomy: for ſo moch as that the maſſe then was no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the ceremony of the lords ſupꝑ, the which was dealt to the church, and the myny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did not take it alone as hath bene vſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hondreth yeares hetherto, againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes expreſſe ordyna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement who ſayd whan he did inſtitute the ſacrament, that thei should take it and dyuide it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not that one alone should receue it. Thei ſawe that this maſſ was that wych made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rych a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mighty: It multiplied the churches reuenewes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in thend it made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyue in delytes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the boke of the anatomy in the chapter of the abuſes of the maſſe, we haue ſayd. And for to wyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> credite, and bring to paſſe that the people should be inclined to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and shuld haue deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there could not be found a thing more to the purpoſe, then to geue men to vnderſtand, and make the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort beleue that Chriſt shuld be in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and that there shuld be made a turning of the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the bread a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the wyne into his body and bluod and to ſaie that there be ſo many myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and to make the thing ſo great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:12148:226"/>
Thei were ſure that if the people were perſuaded that Chriſt were not in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that there were only the bread and the wyne, as holy ſignes, thei wold haue cared littell for it, nor they wold neuer haue beleued that the maſſe shuld haue ſo many vertues, as thei haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand. And thei sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld not haue had that vnmeſurable gaine. ther shuld not haue bene drawen out of that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den well thoes infinite richeſſes. Let euery man that hath reaſon, and is without affection, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he shal find as much as I ſai to be true. This is a ſure rule, if the people did not bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue Chriſt to be in the ſacrament, and were not (I meane the people) bewitched with ſome ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge Imagination, that thei wold make lytle co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt of the maſſe. The popes that ſawe this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odlye inuention to be moch for their purpoſe thei after did, not only with their decrees and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels allowe it but they did bynd the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an people beleue it, as an article of the faith.</p>
            <p>I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the firſt dyuiſers of theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, what cauſes I thinck did moue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeke owt ſo ſtrange Imaginations and ſo farr from the trouth. Of the other, that folowed next after, that is to ſay of the ſcholemen,
<pb facs="tcp:12148:227"/>
I doo not ſai ſoo. As for example of one Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas of Aquine of Bonaua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, of Egidus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus and ſuch lyke as were queſtioniſtes without noumber, and haue dyſputed endleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on the maſter of the ſentences and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intangled the world.</p>
            <p>I think well that the firſt cauſe that is to ſay, the ignorance of the ſcripture did ſeduce them to beleue thus, becauſe they did attend more to the wordly knowleges, and to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>okes of phyloſophy, then to the holy ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. But I doo not beleue that any ſuch malyce did moue them, as moued thoſe firſt inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters. It is true in deede that a nother ignorance made them to erre, that is to ſay, that when they ſawe that the pope and the councels had ſo determined, thei Imagined that they were tyed and bound, to beleue all that that thei had appointed and ordeyned to be beleued of all the faithfull. And therfor thei haue affirmed this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as an article of the faith, thinking they should haue bene heretikes if they sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld haue holden any other wyſe. And to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue this true, certen of them, and among the reſt, Thomas of arge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyne the heremyte, in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:12148:227"/>
fourth, the .xi. diſtinction, ſaye that before the article of the turnke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding was determyned by the church, It was no hereſy to ſai the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is to ſai, that the bread and wyne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne after the conſecration. This is that which deceyued them, the popes auctorytye, whom they thought was Chriſtes lefetenant, and that euery thing that the ſee Apoſtolyke and thoſe councels determyned, was an oracle, againſt the which it was not lawfull to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, the poore ſoules not vnderſtanding, that no man is bound in matters perteyning to fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, to beleue eyther pope or councles, but ſo farr as gods word ſpeaketh, from the which if they ſwarue, though there should come an angel from heauen, we should not be bound, yea I ſay, we ought not to beleue him, as paul ſayth, writing to the galat. And if we haue particular reuerence to any councels,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">A short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſall.</note>It is tyme now that we knyt vp the ſome of this preſent ſermon in the which this article that is whether Chriſt be really and bodyly in the ſacrament of thanks geuing or no, is lar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gely examyned.

and in ſoule, great and thick as he is pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſently in heauen, is whole in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And this opinion is diuided into ij. For ſome ſay that not only Chriſt is in the ſacrament, but that the ſubſtance of the bread and wyne be turned into his body and bluod, and that there remaineth no more, eyther bread or wyne, but the only withco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of the one and the other. Some other ſai that Chriſt is really in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament but the ſubſtances of the bread and wyne remayne, and that there is made no tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them.

            <p>Then further all though that we shuld brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge forth no reaſon for vs, it belongeth not to vs to proue our negatiue, but it belongeth to them that affirme ſuch a being there, to proue their affirmatiue, the which thei did neuer, nor can not doo by any ſaing of the ſcripture. We haue after alſo, made appeare that our op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pinion is of thold church and chefely, Auguſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. And we haue anſwered to the obiections

of the contrary opinion, making it apparant, that, they be vneffectuall, vnpithye, and weak to proue their purpoſe, declaring the maners of ſpeach that the ſcripture vſeth when it tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth of the sacraments. In the end, we haue added from when the falſe Imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that maner error is proceded. And we haue bene long in treating of this article, and we haue made many moo wordes than we thought, and haue repeated the ſelf things often, and haue ſomthing exceded the meaſure of a ſermon, for the which thing the readers shall haue me excuſed. We haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered firſt that the thing was moſt wayghty, and worthy to be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the which could not be done with few wordes.
